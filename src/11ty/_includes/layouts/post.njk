  <p>
    This post is old… It's probably been exported and imported from at least
    three different blogging platforms over the year. That probably means, at
    best, there are broken images and links. If the post is technical in nature,
    any advice is probably out of date and irrelevant. Or more likely, it was
    the wafflings of teenage me with too much time on his hands working out what
    blogging is… If it is the latter I would probably cringe if I re-read it.
    But it's here because it's part of my past, not my present.
