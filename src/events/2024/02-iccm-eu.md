# ICCM Europe 2024

[[toc]]

## Day 1: Use

### Part one

Something to think about…

> Yesterday, how many times do you think you unlocked your phone?

#### Romans 12:2

> Do not be conformed to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is – his good, pleasing and perfect will.

#### 2 John 1:12

> I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete

#### Jeremiah 2:5
> This is what the Lord says:
> "What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves…"

#### Genesis 1:27
> So God created mankind in his own image,
> in the image of God he created them;
> male and female he created them.


#### Discussion questions:

- What tech do you use… but barely think about it as technology?
- Are there specific bits of technology or apps that take up too much time in your life?
- What impact do you see that having on your relationship with God, and the people around you?

---

### Part two

#### A redemptive arc

- Gen 2
- Gen 6
- Exodus 31
- Mark 6
- Luke 23

#### Micah 4:3

> He shall judge between many peoples,
> and shall decide disputes for strong nations far away;
> and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
> and their spears into pruning hooks;
> nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
> neither shall they learn war anymore…

#### Discussion questions:
- Read Galatians 5:22 - Fruit of the Spirit
- Now pick a piece of technology that you use everyday and think about the ways in which it might shape and change you.
- How does that area of technology help / hinder you in living out the Fruit of the Spirit or more broadly your walk with Christ?

## Day 2: Deploy

### Part One

#### Matthew 5:13-16

> You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
> You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

#### Discussion

**Personal integration**

- How does your identity as a Christian shape your thinking about your work?
- When making decisions about the tech that we build, how can we ensure that our choices reflect our commitment to serving God?

**Planning**

- In what ways can we incorporate Christian principles into the planning and implementation of technological solutions?
- Are there guidelines or questions we can we establish as a team to ensure that our technology deployments align with our Christian values?

**Distinctiveness**

- How can we maintain our identity as Kingdom people amidst the fast-paced and often secular environment of technology development and deployment?

**Improvement**

- How can we regularly assess and reflect on our technology deployment practices to ensure that they continue to honour and glorify God?
- What mechanisms can we put in place to facilitate ongoing dialogue and accountability regarding the alignment of our technology deployment efforts with our Christian faith?

---

#### The Tower (Genesis 11)


#### The Tabernacle (Exodus 35)

#### Discussion

**Start here**

- Which of the four principles resonates or challenges you the most: glorifying God, serving others, thinking through consequences, or being prayerful?

**Glory**

- Have you ever felt pressured to build your own “tower" of success or identity? What did that look like for you?
- How can we recognise when we're prioritising our, or our organisation’s, glory over God's glory in our work?

**Service**

- Think about yourself, and the team that you work with; what are the examples where you see service motivated by love?
- How might you deepen and grow that?

**Consequences**

- How do you currently  look at the tech you’re involved with to think about God’s Kingdom?
- Can you think of a specific instance where failing to consider consequences led to unintended outcomes in a project or decision?
- What steps can we take to ensure that our efforts contribute to advancing God's kingdom purposes (eg: promoting justice, reconciliation, serving others)?

**Prayerful**

- How might you cultivate a deeper dependance on God through prayer when thinking about what technology to implement?
- Who do you know around your who models this well? How can you learn from them?

**Other**

- How can we support and encourage each other in maintaining a focus on glorifying God and serving others in our technological endeavours? What could you set up within your teams to support this?

## Day 3: Lead

### Part One - Leading in our organisations

#### Leadership in hiring and training

#### Leadership in serving

#### Leading in staying up to date

#### Discussion

- How does the idea of being a leader within your organisation make you feel? Is it something that comes naturally, or something your are fearful of?
- How can your leadership within your organisation be more shaped by Christ?
- Who models good leadership around you? How might you learn from them?

---

### Part Two - Leadership with our wider influence

#### Leadership in our churches

#### Leadership in our family and friends

#### Leadership with others in tech

#### Discussion

- Who are the people around you who you can get together to start talking about faith and technology?
- What are the questions that people around you are asking about technology? How can you bring your faith more into those answers?
- What example do we set for our families with our use of technology?
