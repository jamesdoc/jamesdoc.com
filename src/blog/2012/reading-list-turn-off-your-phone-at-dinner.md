 I&#39;ve just read a fantastic article on the Relevant Magazine website about being too plugged in to technology. I&#39;m just going to pull out three quotes below and then you should go and read the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/tech/features/29071-turn-off-your-phone-at-dinner" target="_blank">full article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 &ldquo;Quality time is something that&rsquo;s important to me, so when [my friends are] always on their devices, it&rsquo;s like that quality time isn&rsquo;t quality anymore,&rdquo; [Chelsea] says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just time.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 &quot;When technology is turned off and put away, face-to-face conversations cultivate intimacy and add depth to relationships. Cultivating an attitude of mindfulness is one way to fight against the need of simultaneously managing multiple conversations. More than a technique, mindfulness is an attitude of, &#39;I&rsquo;m going to be fully present with you&hellip; It&rsquo;s the hard work of being attentive. We&rsquo;re losing that.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 &ldquo;Be still and know that I am God,&quot; [Timothy] Muehlhoff quotes from the Psalms. &quot;Have we lost the ability to be still? That would concern me if we have.&quot;</blockquote>
