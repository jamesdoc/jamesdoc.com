 I initially drafted this post last month, but it quickly became a very long rant that I didn&#39;t want to read! So I shelved it for a bit and have come back to it today; I&#39;ve condensed my thoughts into a &#39;<i>how to use QR codes well</i>&#39; post. &nbsp;Below are a couple of solutions for what has irritated me about how I&#39;ve seen QR codes used…</p>
<p>
 <b>Remember <i>my</i> memory; I can&#39;t remember a QR code.</b></p>
<p>
 QR codes are designed to be read by machines, and the machines read them very well. However I can&#39;t read a QR code. Lets imagine a hypothetical situation where I don&#39;t have my smart phone on me, or my smart phone doesn&#39;t have QR reading software, or maybe I don&#39;t own a smart phone; if I see a QR code, there is nothing I can do with it. If you display a QR code, please provide a fall back for me; a nice short web address is all I need; I can write that down, maybe even remember it! When there is just a QR code without any human readable text you lose a large part of your audience.</p>
<p>
 <b>Remember <i>my</i> location; can I scan it?</b></p>
<p>
 Mobile phone cameras have come a long way in the last 5 years, phones being released at the moment have 8 megapixel cameras, pretty fantastic zoom, etc&hellip; but they are still not as good as my eyes. So while I may be able to see your QR code, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll be able to scan it. Perhaps it has been placed too high on a billboard, perhaps it is too low to the ground, perhaps it has been placed at eye level but the code is too small because I am too far away&hellip; Wherever I am, the code has got to be scannable. Oh, and putting QR codes on the underground&hellip; it is just silly - of course I can scan it, but I don&#39;t have the network coverage to do anything with the web address you give me! This leads me nicely into the next point…</p>
<p>
 <b>Remember <i>my</i> context; the destination matters.</b></p>
<p>
 When I scan a QR code, I am <i>going</i> to be using a mobile device, there is almost no doubt about this. I could be using a phone, I may be on a tablet&hellip; either way I won&#39;t be using a desktop computer. So when I scan a QR code I really don&#39;t want to be taken through to a page that doesn&#39;t work well on mobile device. The code should either point to a mobile version of a website or the website has some great responsive web design going on. An additional thing; don&#39;t make the page in Flash; remember I&#39;m on a mobile phone!</p>
<p>
 <b>Remember <i>my</i> investment; I like to be rewarded.</b></p>
<p>
 Scanning a QR code can be a hassle, getting the phone out of the pocket, finding the correct app, maybe even downloading the correct app for the first time, scanning and then going to the website. Remember that I am investing time in your code; so make it worth while for me, give me something special! Perhaps it is a video (bearing in mind I&#39;m on a mobile - low res will do), perhaps it is a discount for your store, perhaps it is just more information, either way make it rewarding.</p>
<p>
 <b>Remember <i>my</i> knowledge; QR codes are still new</b></p>
<p>
 Yes, QR codes are shiny and new, yes everyone seems to be using them, yes lots of people seem to understand what they are&hellip; however don&#39;t make the assumption that says &#39;<i>it&#39;s shiny and new, everyone seems to be using them therefore everyone knows what they are and how to use them&#39;</i>. This is wrong, many people do know how to use QR code, but many people don&#39;t. Please tell your users how to use a QR code, they will thank you for it.</p>
<p>
 <b>Remember <i>your</i> strategy; how does it fit?</b></p>
<p>
 Based on the &#39;shiny and new&#39; principle you can easily fall into another false assumption; &#39;<i>it&#39;s shiny and new, everyone seems to be using them therefore I must use a QR code&#39;</i>. You really don&#39;t! Just because everyone else is using them, that doesn&#39;t mean you must do it to keep up with everyone else. Seriously think about why you are using them. Ask questions like &#39;will this bring value to my advert?&#39; or &#39;will my audience know how to scan a code and will they want to scan the code?&#39;. Another important thing to ask is &#39;why should I use a QR code rather than a simple web address?&#39;.</p>
