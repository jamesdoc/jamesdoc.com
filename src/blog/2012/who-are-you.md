<p> This fantastic quote appeared on my <a href="https://twitter.com/soulsailor/status/224207075390144512" target="_blank">twitter stream</a> earlier today:</p><blockquote> <p> You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences. The German writer Goethe said, &#39;We are shaped and fashioned by what we love&#39;.</p> <small>Austin Kleon - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0074QGGK6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0074QGGK6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jamdoc-21" target="_blank"><cite>Steal Like an Artist</cite></a></small></blockquote><p> What do you think?</p>
