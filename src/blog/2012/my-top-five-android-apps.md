<p> I&#39;ve been an Android user for a while, lots of apps have come an gone off my phone over that time. So I thought it was about time I composed a list of the apps that I consider to be some of the best available&hellip; And because I&#39;m cheap, they are also my top five free Android apps!</p><h3> One: Google chrome</h3><p> There is very little wrong with the built in browser with Android. However when I can have my bookmarks nicely synced and send pages directly from my desktop to my mobile it just seems a no-brainer! The original beta for Android was a little bit buggy, however they have worked most of the issues out and Chrome for Android is a really nice bit of kit.</p><p> Google chrome on Google Play:<br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome</a></p><h3> Two: Everyday notes // Do it tomorrow</h3><p> Okay, I&#39;m sneakily bundling two apps into one entry, but they are are very similar! Made by Adylitica these apps are like having Moleskine notebooks on your phone. Do it tomorrow is a &#39;getting things done&#39; app with a simple idea; things can either be done today or tomorrow. Anything that you put off till tomorrow moves to today as the clock strikes midnight. Very clever.</p><p> Everyday notes has been on iOS for a while and has just made the jump across to Android. It is designed as a notebook with entries for each day. You can use it as a to do, as a diary, as notebook, as a whatever. It lacks some of the features of the iOS app such as calendar sync, however I&#39;m sure they will appear soon enough.</p><p>Normally I don&#39;t buy into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph" target="_blank">skeuomorphic</a> designs within apps, I think that Apple&#39;s address book and calendar looks awful, however these apps by Adylitica both look great and I&#39;m enjoying using them daily.</p><p> Everyday notes on Google Play:<br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adylitica.activity" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adylitica.activity</a></p><p>Do it tomorrow on Google Play:<br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adylitica.android.DoItTomorrow" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adylitica.android.DoItTomorrow</a></p><h3>Three: ESV Bible</h3><p> There are hundreds of Bible apps on the Play store, the majority are a little bit bloated with hundreds of features. The ESV does the Bible simply and clearly, with great navigation and no bloat. As long as you don&#39;t want to be able to jump from translation to translation (check out the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sirma.mobile.bible.android" target="_blank">YouVersion app</a> for that) the ESV app does a great job.</p><p> ESV Bible on Google Play:<br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.subsplash.esv" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.subsplash.esv</a></p><h3> Four: National rail enquiries</h3><p> I don&#39;t have much to say about this app, it is one of my most used apps simply because I use the great British rail service so often. It has nice features such as geolocating the nearest train station to you and a big &#39;get me home&#39; button. Handy.</p><p> National rail enquiries on Google Play: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.nationalrail.google" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.nationalrail.google</a></p><h3> Five: Tweet lanes</h3><p> I have to confess that I&#39;ve only been using Tweet lanes for an afternoon&hellip; however I&#39;m pretty convinced that I&#39;ll be ditching the official Twitter app for it. It has a nice <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/style/themes.html" target="_blank">Holo</a> user interface which just gives a great consistent experience and a really clever conversation view. I really like this app.</p><p> Tweet lanes on Google Play:<br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tweetlanes.android" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tweetlanes.android</a></p><hr /><h3> Some honourable mentions:</h3><p> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android" target="_blank">Instagram</a> - I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to explain this one…</p><p> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zegoggles.smssync" target="_blank">SMS Backup+</a> - Great method of backing up all text messages to GMail</p><p> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trello" target="_blank">Trello</a> - Wonderful app enabling access to the project management tool Trello</p><p> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> - Quick access to the files held in your Dropbox</p>
