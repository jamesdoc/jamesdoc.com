<p> I&#39;m not sure if you have seen it or not, but recently there has been a list that has gone vital over Twitter and Facebook. <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/british-people-problems">21 Brilliant British People Problems</a> was posted on Buzz Feed on the 18th Dec and has attracted a fair amount of attention because it hits the mark so well with some brilliant British stereotypes.</p><p> Number 8 is entirely true - &quot;<i>My girlfriend claims to be &#39;neither here not there&#39; on Marmite. Now I can&#39;t trust anything she says or does</i>&quot;, there is no on the fence with this, Marmite reactions can only be love or hate, there is no mid ground on this issue. Or &quot;<i>Having my haircut, the barber said &#39;is that alright?&#39; I nodded. It wasn&#39;t</i>&quot; is a another fairly standard part of being British. However number 18 on the list just doesn&#39;t quite sit right with me&hellip;</p><blockquote> <p> &quot;<i>I apologise for not smoking when someone asks me for a light.</i>&quot;</p></blockquote><p> When a person who smokes asks me for a lighter, I admit that I do turn to them and say something along the lines of &quot;<i>Sorry mate; I don&#39;t smoke.</i>&quot; But it is not the lack of smoking I am apologising for. I am saying sorry for not being able to help the person out, the &quot;<i>I don&#39;t smoke</i>&quot; part is simply giving a reason for not being able to help.</p><p> I hope that clears that issue up.</p>
