<p> I had big plans to post something today about the <a href="http://www.newmediacentreofexcellence.org.uk/cnmac/conference" target="_blank">Christian New Media Conference</a> which I attended over the weekend, however as Evernote totally failed to sync the blog that I was drafting I finished off this manipulation that I was working on.</p><p> The photo credit goes to Martin Robson who took this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/martinrobson/5758860361/">stunning photo of Brighton&#39;s West Pier</a> and was kind enough to put it under the Creative Commons license.</p><p> The finished piece is <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/assets/graphics/brighton.jpg" target="_blank">free for download</a>&nbsp;under the same <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons license</a>.</p>
