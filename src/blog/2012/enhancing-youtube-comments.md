 Just a quick post today to share a something I have been using for the last few months which has completely improved my experience of YouTube;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chrisfinke.com/comment-snob/" target="_blank">Comment Snob</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chrisfinke.com/" target="_blank">Chris Finke</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">
 Comment Snob is a Google Chrome extension which simply filters user&#39;s comments against a set of rules to deem if a comment is probably spam, trolling or just simply written by a 13 year old with their finger on the SHIFT BUTTON.&nbsp;With these comments out of the way you are left in peace to enjoy comments left on a video.</p>
<p class="p1">
 There are plenty of rules built into it, and if you are handy with jQuery you can easily build your own.</p>
<p class="p1">
 You can grab the extension from the&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gfbnmebccmipejnnlcaenkhfhniaielg" target="_blank">Google Chrome Store</a>.</p>

 Share and enjoy!</p>
