<p>Some of you may have noticed that in the last couple of weeks I&#39;ve pushed a fairly major update to my website, version 6 by my reckoning. I&#39;ve ditched the dark red and black instead favouring a white background, and now have several shades of tea for highlighting different content types. I&#39;ve also used this opportunity to start playing around a bit with CSS transforms, part of the CSS3 specification.</p>
<p>One of the major goals for v6 were to simplify the design and to make it more readable. I took inspiration from the blogs of <a href="http://miekd.com/" target="_blank">Maykel Loomans</a> and the <a href="http://informationarchitects.net/blog/" target="_blank">Information Architects</a> who both have stunningly simple and readable websites. One of the major things that stuck me by their designs was the narrow width of the site, meaning that they don&#39;t try and squeeze too many words into each line of text.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got several minor updates mulling around in my mind that I want to sit down and work up at some point in the near future including good Open Graph support, searching in the blog, a&nbsp;<a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/archive/2012" target="_blank">better archive</a>&nbsp;design, some improvements to the menu, etc. However I would really value your feedback; what do you like or dislike? How can I make improvements to the site? What should I be writing about? Let me know in the comments below!</p>
