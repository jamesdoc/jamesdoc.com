 I&#39;ve got several plans and aims for this year&hellip; one of them is to do more things with this site; that means that there will be tweaks and adjustments to the design of the site, but more importantly more blog posts ranging from opinions and reviews to simple quotes that I&#39;ve found inspiring or thought provoking.&nbsp;Today I&#39;m going for a quote from the book of Proverbs.</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>Let your eyes look straight ahead;&nbsp;fix your gaze directly before you.</em><br />
  <em>Give careful thought to the paths for your feet&nbsp;and be steadfast in all your ways.</em></p>
 <p>
  Proverbs 4:25-26</p>
</blockquote>

 Another year has past, 2011 was a very mixed year for me; with mistakes and success - many lessons to learn. Now as I head into 2012 it&#39;s time to learn from last year, it&#39;s time&nbsp;to carefully think about where I want to go and to move forward on that path.</p>

 Matthew Henry concludes his commentary on this section in Proverbs with the words: <em>&quot;…looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God&#39;s word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.&quot; </em>I think that would be my prayer for 2012.</p>
