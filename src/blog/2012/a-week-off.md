<p> I&#39;ve just spent the last week doing very little work, very little checking email and generally avoiding social media. It is to be recommended. As a replacement I&#39;ve caught up with a couple of friends, spent time outside in the country, watched some Olympics at Eton Dorney (Canoe Sprint) seen a musical (Singin&#39; in the Rain), seen a Dodo and generally had a restful time. Wonderful.</p><p> I&#39;ve now got another week of work before heading to <a href="https://vimeo.com/28862291">The Track</a> for a week that doesn&#39;t resemble work or rest... something in the middle perhaps?</p><p> August is a funny month.&nbsp;Perhaps September will be more normal?</p>
