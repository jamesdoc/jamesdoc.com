<p> One of the things that I have started doing at work is putting together a style guide so we can communicate in a consistant way. I fear it&#39;s going to be a really boring document to read, but I&#39;m loving adding to it every now and again. It&#39;s got important things in it like how to format dates and times and how to correctly link to pages in news articles. Facinating I&#39;m <em>sure </em>you&#39;ll agree.</p><p> Of course much of this is highly debated, should links include &#39;www.&#39; or not (they shouldn&#39;t)? Should a person&#39;s job title be seperated from their name with a comma, a colon and dash?</p><p> The big question that seems to be dividing opinion this evening is; as I write this post am I writing <em>on</em> a blog, or am I writing <em>in</em> a blog?</p><p> It seems the internet is divided as well. A search on Google for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=" target="_blank">&quot;on the blog&quot;</a>&nbsp; yields 617,000,000 results, while <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=" target="_blank">&quot;in the blog&quot;</a> gives 606,000,000 results, interestingly when I searched by <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=" target="_blank">&quot;on a blog&quot;</a> I received 308,000,000 results, in comparison <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=" target="_blank">&quot;in a blog&quot;</a> returned 401,000,000 results.</p><p> And opinions were mixed when I posed the question on Twitter:</p><blockquote> <p> @jamesdoc on<br /> <a href="https://twitter.com/willpower232/status/225629684312977408" target="_blank"><small>@willpower232</small></a></p></blockquote><blockquote> <p> @jamesdoc &#39;in a blog&#39;, for no reason other than that it sounds better. But surely that&#39;s the definition of grammar, right?<br /> <a href="https://twitter.com/_DPeterK_/status/225630984282980352" target="_blank"><small>@_DPeterK_</small></a></p></blockquote><blockquote> <p> @jamesdoc how about &quot;jamesdoc has written his blog&quot;/&quot;updated his blog&quot; these both avoid the in/on issue.<br /> <a href="https://www.twitter.com/the_lanky1/status/225631192723099649" target="_blank"><small>@the_lanky1</small></a></p></blockquote><p> What do you think? Does it matter? Or am I getting wrapped up over small details?</p>
