It's been a while since I wrote a blog post… it's been on my mind to get back into writing words in order for a a few months now. But about a year ago I took down my old site (The old site was PHP, [Codeigniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/) + MySQL) and replaced it with a simple one pager.

When I did that, I had in the back of my mind to update everything to be built off of a static site generator, but I never really made the time to do that (I had toyed with a couple between then and now, Metalsmith and Gatsby, but didn't really get far). Today I replaced everything with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/). It bills itself as _"a simpler static site generator"_. So far my experience has been pretty positive.

I've been reading through the [documentation](https://www.11ty.io/docs/) and over the shoulders of [some great people on the internet](https://github.com/Wilto/wilto-makes-food/) to get my head around how it all works.

My setup at the moment is Eleventy + [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) + [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) + [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). Keeping it simple. The code is all on [it's Github repo](https://github.com/jamesdoc/jamesdoc.com) so you can look over my shoulder if you so desire.

There's a lot more that I want to do with this:

- ✅ <s>backfill the old blog posts from the old blog</s>.<br/>Done: September '18
- ✅ <s>add in [canonical links](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en) for content that I originally posted elsewhere</s>.<br/>Done: August '18
- ✅ <s>add in links to blog posts I've written elsewhere on the internet</s>.<br/>Done: August '18
- ✅ <s>being able to handle responsive images well…</s>.<br/>Done: December '18
- ✅ <s>actually images at all in blog posts would be nice</s>.<br/>Done: September '18 ([example](/blog/2018/kc-ideas-to-reality/))
- ✅ <s>Implement [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). Because RSS is _not_ dead.</s> Done: October '19
- ✅ <s>Paginate the [blog listing page](/blog)</s>.<br />Done: Jan '21 ([Blog post](/blog/2021/11ty-posts-by-year/))
- I've also got some design work for a simple side navigation too.

But one step at a time.
