Due to the fact that Blogger has become blogger beta and is therefore rubbish... Live Writer can't publish to it... So if you want to read the latest blog check it out at <a href="http://jamesdoc.spaces.live.com/">http://jamesdoc.spaces.live.com</a> which Live Writer can publish to! Oh and if someone can tell me how to create a heading in blogger it would be appreciated! [Don't worry, found it!]

Update: currently blogging at [jamesdoc.com](https://jamesdoc.com).
