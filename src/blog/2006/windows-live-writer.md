<p>Having just been away at Soul Survivor for a week, which was great,&nbsp;I've come back home to find that this program called Windows Live&nbsp;Writer has been made, and I have to say that it is very good!&nbsp; You&nbsp;can input your details and it will publish a blog to any number of&nbsp;blog services such as&nbsp;Live Spaces and Blogger.</p> <p align="justify&quot;">With it you can put in <a href="http://www.yfriday.org.uk">links</a>, which looks at your IE history.&nbsp; You can put in images&nbsp;which look very good and you can put effects on them and stuff! And finally using the power of Windows Live Local, the mapping system you can put maps in if you want to!&nbsp; </p> <p></p> <p>Yer so that is Windows Live Writer and I highly recommend it!&nbsp; lol.</p> <p>Other interesting news:</p> <ul> <li>New Relient K album in Novemember  <li>yFriday will have 3 live tracks on the up coming Emerging Cultures album in October  <li>onehundredhours will release an album by this time next year  <li>Tim Hughes has an album coming out in October  <li>Delirious? will be releasing their live DVD, CD and book in October  <li>In SG:A Doctor McKay may well be dupilcated so there are two of them  <li>Season 9 of SG1 will be on the shelves on October 3rd</li></ul>
