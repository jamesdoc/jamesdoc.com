<p>There it is, the Google Toolbar, one of the more installed toolbars for a web browser.&nbsp; Incuding a search box, spell checked, auto forms, and various other useful features!&nbsp; However I highly recommend NOT installing it.</p> <p>On Windows XP after&nbsp;a random amount of time, when you switch user accounts and run explorer you receive an error that looks similar to this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library <br>Runtime Error! </p> <p>Program: C:WINDOWSEXPLORER.EXE <br>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate in an unusual way. </p> <p>Please contact the application's support team for more information. </p></blockquote> <p>The easiest way to either sort or prevent this error is to uninstall the Google Toolbar straight away and restart your computer, problem solved! I'm not completely sure why this happens, I <u>think</u> it is something to do with the Microsoft updates&nbsp;conflicting with the the toolbar...</p>
