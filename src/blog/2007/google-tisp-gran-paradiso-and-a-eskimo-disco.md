<p>Google's Aprils Fool's day joke has reached a new level this year with the release of ANOTHER beta product: <a href="http://www.google.com/tisp/" target="_blank">Google TiSP</a> [Toilet Internet Service Provider].  The joke was based on a quote by Ted Stevens a US Senator who said 'The interent is not something you just dump something on.  It's not a big truck.  It's a series of tubes..."  Taking this literally the guys at Google have 'created' a router that works though the toilet system.  The system provides in-home wirless access by connecting your TiSP to thousands of access nodes via fibre optic cables in the sewage system.</p> <p>On the serious side though Google have released and update for GMail that enables users without a printer to get paper copies of emails quickly and easily.  <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.htm" target="_blank">GMail Paper</a> is a small little add on to the GMail interface a few simple clicks and the email is printed out at the nearest Google offices and posted to you.  And for those concerned about the enviroment Google will print them onto 96% recycled paper.  They even claim that 'for every GMail Paper we produce, the enviroment gets incrementally healthier'.</p> <p>On a different note I have just downloaded Gran Paradiso Alpha 1 on to my laptop.  What does that mean?  It's FireFox 3, the new code name for it anyway!  And so far it is running fairly well, a few annoying bugs to fix, however it has definatly improved.  The code and images are rendered in a different fashion improving the quality and the speed of the browser.  Also it can now view APNG files (animated PNG's) which is always nice.  SVG elements have been fixed so that they are spec compliance, the real question that needs to be asked is... 'Will it pass the ACID 2 test?'  The result is below:</p> <p>Well done Mozilla!</p> <p>Finally... an Eskimo Disco?  A while back Matt introduced me to a small video on YouTube called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7RcqRmBlIQ" target="_blank">7-11</a>, a 4 minute long dance track set to a Pingu style video, it was, and still is rather good.  Well after a bit of digging I found that the band who wrote the song had another video on YouTube called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_IB-njwEGU" target="_blank">Picture Perfect</a>, which is another very good video.  I eventually found their <a href="http://www.eskimodisco.com/" target="_blank">website</a> after a short wait it finally loaded (smegging flash, I'll rant about that later!) Full track samples are up there and I have to say that I am very impressed with them.  I have no more to say.  I'll rant later on flash!</p>
