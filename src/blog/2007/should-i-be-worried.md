<p>Just done a little bit of internet browsing as you do and was scared to come across a picture of myself on an American's site!!! They had been to a Delirious? gig and managed to snap a picture of me on the big screen... Its a small world, but a cool photo!  (If anyone is really that interested it's from the History Maker visual)</p> <img src="http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/862/jameslooksoverdelirious.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="100%" />
