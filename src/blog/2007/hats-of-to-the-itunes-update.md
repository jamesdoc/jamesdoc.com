<p>Those who know me fairly well know that I used to be a real Apple hater and have since 'seen the light' (or the shiny white appleness) and now own an iPod and have been forced (though now rather like it) iTunes.</p> <p>Well today I downloaded the update to iTunes, iTunes 7.1 and what does the .1 include?&nbsp; Well! Ovio usly they would have to update iTunes to cope with AppleTV so there is now a nice feature that allows AppleTV to connect with iTunes and vice-versa.&nbsp; And oviously there will be the iPhone added into that as well.</p> <p>However the nicest part can be found within the coverflow section of iTunes.&nbsp; Normally you would be able to browse through your album art using coverflow, however now Apple have added a little button below the cover flow to put cover flow full screen making the the screen more presentable and a whole lot cooler!&nbsp; This feature is over all of iTunes now, including Party Shuffle, meaning that you can have iTunes running quietly in the background and on screen the nice album art, including ablum name, artist and track details.&nbsp; Also playing/pause, skipping track &amp; volume can be control from this screen!&nbsp; Very cool Apple!&nbsp; Well done!</p>
