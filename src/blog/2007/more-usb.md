<p>Some may remember a few blogs ago I wrote about pointless USB devices. Well while I was in Argos today on the shelf I found a USB Aroma Diffuser:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"The scent and therapeutic properties of essential oils are delivered conveniently and effectively with this USB Aroma Diffuser. The device plugs into your USB port for power and operates at a steady temperature to heat oils and scented wax, providing a relaxing stream of your preferred fragrance.&nbsp;(oils not included)"</em></p></blockquote> <p>&lt;rant&gt;</p> <p>WHY do you need your USB port to do this??? The USB port is not made for powering small little toys, USB ports should be used for things like flash drives or plugging printers and scanners into, they are useful for that kind of thing. Why do you need your USB port to fire small little bits of foam at you or plug in little fairy lights into? This aroma diffuser, whats wrong with putting a little candle under the scent and burning it that way LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE???</p> <p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-2438897589180246563?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
