<p>I've finally got round to installing proper webcam software on my computer, this is a result of the Creative software that the camera came with not doing the job it is supposed to do! So now an image of my room and who ever happens to be sitting at my computer can be found at <a href="http://www.jamesdoc.co.nr" target="_blank">www.jamesdoc.co.nr</a>. It is all very exciting!</p>
<p>Update: This is hugely outdated and no longer exists. K thx bai.</p>
