<p>Second set of exams today... that was fun! Spent three hours on computing exam, wahey. I did not enjoy it! It became a case of 45 minutes work followed by 45 minutes rest (the test was an hour and a half) and then the second paper doing the same! Ah well, I am glad that is out of the way! Three more subjects to go and seven exams! Classical Civ tomorrow afternoon... I really should be revising for that. Hum, I'll start after tea!</p> <p>I feel that I should write another paragraph! However as it stands I have nothing futher to add... so I'll go and do something that isn't revision... time to go forum checking!</p>
