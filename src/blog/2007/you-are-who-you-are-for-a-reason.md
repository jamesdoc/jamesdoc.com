<p>I was doing my purpose driven life reading last night and came across this poem, I quite like it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You are who you are for a reason,</br>
You're part of an intricate plan.</br>
You're a precious and perfect unique design,</br>
Called God's special woman or man.
</p>
<p>You look like you for a reason.</br>
Our God made no mistake.</br>
He knit you together within the womb,</br>
You're just what he wanted to make.</p>
<p>The parents you had were the ones he chose,</br>
And no matter how you may feel,</br>
They were custom-designed with God's plan in mind,</br>
And they bear the Master's seal.</p>
<p>No, that trauma you faced was not easy.</br>And God wept that it hurt you so;</br>But it was allowed to shape your heart,</br>So that into his likeness you'd grow. </p>
<p>You are who you are for a reason</br>You've been former by the Master's rod.</br>You are who you are, beloved,</br>Because there is a God!</p>
