<p>&lt;rant version="1.01" type="tech"&gt;</p> <p>James is getting very annoyed with the social networking group who set up tagging.&nbsp; A sample of one of my friends inbox showed just how bad this whole tagging thing has got.&nbsp; There were three pages of people who had tagged her.&nbsp; And what was more people had tagged her more that once, Becca had tagged her over 10 times! WHY??? Can't this company sort themselves out?&nbsp; One nice feature of GMail is that you can set up filters to search for the phrase "has Tagged you! :)" and automagically delete it, which is brilliant, but I feel sorry for all the sorry people who have to sift through all this spam regularly.</p> <p>This is why I like Facebook, and, although being another social networking site it has the capabability to work out who wants it and who doesn't.&nbsp; If you are invited to it they will send one email.&nbsp; If the same person invites you again it won't send anything! Brilliant!&nbsp; Then if you tell it you no longer wish to recieve these emails it will veto your email from the system.&nbsp; Ahh, I think some companies could learn from Facebook, *cough* MySpace, Bebo, etc.</p> <p>Another way in which Facebook trumps these sites is that you cannot change the design.&nbsp; Brilliant!&nbsp; This means that the people who cannot design pages do not get the opertunity to do so, the ammount of MySpace's that I have seen that just look shocking, the internet community learn't that animated GIF's should not be used as backgrounds!&nbsp; This site: <a title="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/anim/ab.html" href="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/anim/ab.html">http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/anim/ab.html</a>&nbsp;just isn't cool.&nbsp; However hats off to this website: <a title="http://blueballfixed.ytmnd.com/" href="http://blueballfixed.ytmnd.com/">http://blueballfixed.ytmnd.com/</a>&nbsp;hours of entertainment there!</p> <p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
