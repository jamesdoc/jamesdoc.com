<p>Yes, I know this is not sounds like an exciting post I know, however last night Facebook released Facebook Polls which is as it sounds; it enables users to create polls to put on their profile for a slight fee.  Shocking I know, however that isn't the reason for this blog.</p> <p>Facebook limits what you can put on these polls which is rather useless, my first poll contains a restricted word: 'Is Facebook better than Myspace?' Now what part of that is restricted? I don't see in any part of the terms and conditions DON'T MENTION THE COMPETITION!  However for some reason when you insult Facebook, 'Does Facebook limit freedom of speech?', it has no problem with it!  Weird!  And it doesn't have a problem with 'Is Facebook better than Communist China?'</p> <p>My next blog won't be on various social networking... honest... 8 days until WWDC :-)</p>
