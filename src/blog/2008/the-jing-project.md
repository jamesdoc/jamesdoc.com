The amount of times I end up taking screenshots for people who want help with something on their computer is fairly high, because most of the time it is quicker to send them a couple of pictures showing a step by step guide of what is happening than spending hours on the phone getting them to click a mouse. So I have to take my hat off to the guys who created Jing... Basically what it does is it takes a photo of a specific area and then allows you to play with it, draw/type on it, then upload it to the world wide web... Generally very cunning! Click <a href="http://screencast.com/t/tn6rB98DSD" target="null">here</a> for what it uploaded<br /><br />It can also do video... <a href="http://screencast.com/t/HqyQ7ogN1PR" target="null">clicky</a>.<br /><br />At the moment it is in a free stage so get it while it is around:<br /><a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">http://www.jingproject.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Also an additional note: it is towel day tomorrow :)
