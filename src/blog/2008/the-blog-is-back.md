<p>Well I'm not sure if back is the right way of putting it - this may just be a one off post, however it will be what it is! The time is 00:45 and I am very much awake so I need to kill some time before I feel tired and want to go to bed!</p><p>Currently I am listening to Audio Adrenaline... I wouldn't put them anywhere near my favourite bands... however they do have some good tracks - Ocean Floor being one of those amazing tracks! Despite this their albums just don't deliver.</p><p>Whilst we are on the music topic; new yFriday CD/DVD, The Universal Broadcast, should be coming through the mail within the next few days which is rather exciting!  There is also noise of a worship CD being recorded later this year which will be rather cool, something to put alongside Songs of Heaven.  I may ask the guys about this if I manage to catch up with them at Spring Harvest this year... w00t.</p><p>I have big plans to completely re-do my website in the summer before university if I get the time, however if my other plans actually work I won't get the time as I will be earning money... However that involves me getting a job... anyone want to hire me? No? ok... The plans for the website are as follows:</p><p></p><ol><li>Redesign - obviously! The site is old and could look a lot nicer</li><li>Integrated Blog - create a blogging program that works!  The design to be based on Facebook's notes!  Not that I would steal/borrow ideas...</li><li>Editable Pages - Being able to update the site without having to go and edit code and upload files will be brilliant!</li><li>Whatever else comes mind be it photo gallery or forum... we will see!</li></ol><div>Hum... I think that will do for now... I think I'll go read a chapter of a book now!  I've almost finished Christopher Reeve's autobiography... I will never read an autobiography again. Ever.</div><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-994090732428670878?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
