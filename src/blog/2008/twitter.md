<div>I've just started using twitter... I signed up a while ago, however have only just started using it!  I think that may have something to do with avoiding revision!  Anyway!  I have two friends on Twitter at the moment, if anyone else is using it and wants to be my friend please add me; www.twitter.com/jamesdoc!</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-6271759091065851633?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
