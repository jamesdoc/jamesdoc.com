I've retaken the two photos for this little toy, and then redid the effect spending a little more time on it, I think it looks a lot better now! Make your own mind up though!

General note, on the 15th (two days time) I will be taking part in Blog Action Day, the event is a nonprofit event that aims to unite the world 's bloggers, podcasters and videocasters, to post about the same topic on the same day. The aim is to raise awareness and trigger a global discussion. That sounds as if it has just been copied and pasted from their site... (it was)! Basically on the 15th I will be writing a post about a form of poverty in the world, as will about 8000 other bloggers in the world, it is just something to make you think. I encourage as many of you who read this blog to check out <a href="http://blogactionday.org/" target="null">blogactionday.org</a> and write your own blog post or facebook note on Thursday.
