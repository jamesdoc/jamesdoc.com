So during Sunday evening I went to see a band called Bluetree. I genuinely cannot express how good I thought they were! For those who haven't heard of them Bluetree are a Northern Ireland Christian band formed of six members. They formed in 2004 within their local church and have been doing various gigs across the United Kingdom and Ireland and have also played gigs in America, Canada and Thailand.

While I was working in Wesley Owen over the summer I played their album 'Greater Things' fairly regularly and was seriously impressed with the whole album, however foolishly did not purchase it… Well many moons later, 3 if you are picky, they played in Lincoln. Seriously the passion that they put into their set was just amazing, the energy within them was just fantastic.

Their set list was as follows:

<ol><li>Standing Out</li><li>God's Plan</li><li>You Go Before</li><li>God of the City</li><li>Your Love</li><li>When I Survey (Isaac Watts &amp; Lowell Mason)</li><li>River</li><li>Each Day</li><li>Shine Jesus Shine (Graham Kendrick)</li><li>Lifes Noise</li><li>For You</li><li>Happy Day (Tim Hughes)</li></ol>

They did Shine Jesus Shine, and not only did they get away with it… they did an amazing version of it full of drums, guitars, keys and weird little beeps and whistles. I'm hoping to get an audio recording of this!

Next year (2009) they are going full time as a band, quitting the day job and I seriously believe that they will make it. They have such great potential and with the dwindling number of UK based Christian bands at the moment now is the right time to do it. I highly recpommend their album 'Greater Things' which can be purchased from <a href="https://direct.crossrhythms.co.uk/product/46208" target="_blank">Cross Rhythms</a> at the the low price of &pound;8.97. Or check out their MySpace which has 3 of the tracks from their album up on it: <a href="https://www.myspace.com/bluetreeonline" target="_blank">myspace.com/bluetreeonline</a>.

This band is going somewhere, they have already been picked up in the US thanks to Chris Tomlin covering 'God of the City' on his latest CD 'Hello Love'. Recently they have done a tour of USA, performed at The Stand and will be supporting Delirious? at their annual Christmas Show at the Shepherds Bush Empire.
