Hum... so much for the regularly blogging... Ah well it's as if it is a requirement to life!

Right today... scary nasty horrible coursework exam done so James is rather happy that it is over and done with! 20% of final grade on a stupid piece of 'controlled coursework' means we wrote the coursework up a few times condensed it down to notes and then wrote it up again under exam conditions from the notes... WHAT IS THE POINT?!? garg... my hand is now sore. However I'm glad its out of the way.

More exciting blog entry coming soon!!!
