This is the result of my creative tech workshop... exciting eh? Should I get some spare time this week I will be redoing it, however Richard would be upset if I didn't put this online!

Got a busy couple of days coming up so we shall see! Get to try out my new studded boots tomorrow at frisbee, see if they make a difference!
