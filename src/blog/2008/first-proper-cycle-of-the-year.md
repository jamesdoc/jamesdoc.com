Yes it is now official! Today, myself and Matt got onto our bikes and headed for the Downs. It proved one major thing - we are SO out of practice! Hehe! It was a really good time though! Over Downs into Bramber and then up Mill Hill and back down into Shoreham!<br />Really good weather if not a bit cold! Got a chance to wear my cycling trousers for a change though! Normally I just stick to jeans! They were nice and warm! P)<br />Got a busy few days coming up now, the blog may vanish for a bit, however we will try and get a quick one here and there!
