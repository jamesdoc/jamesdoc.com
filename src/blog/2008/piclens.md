<div><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/piclens_ruby.jpg" />PicLens has just been updated for FireFox 3 which in itself is amazing, however they have added YouTube support.  This add-on has become almost perfect!</div><div>For those who have not come across this application it is an add on for Safari and FireFox which allows you to search photos from your browser window, it describes itself as an 'immersive, full-screen experience' and it is not wrong, the design of it is amazing!  You can simply type into the search box and search image sites like Google Images or from Flickr to see a wall of images.  Also compatible with Facebook and Picasa photo galleries... I love it!</div><div>The update, allowing FireFox 3 support also allows videos to be played in this block from sites like YouTube or Google Videos which is far too cool... I think much time will be wasted through this!</div><div>If you are interested head across to <a href="http://www.piclens.com/">http://www.piclens.com/</a> for a full preview and a video clip of the application in action!<br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-2169193371646423882?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
