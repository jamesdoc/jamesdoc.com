For those who don't know [Pleo](http://www.pleoworld.com/) is an amazing animatronic little robot dinosaur that aside from being totally cute is a stunning piece of engineering. So much so that you can program the thing to do what you want with it, such as a [dances](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJabysPLmps) or just generally messing about with [them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POVFepuGoic).

However some sad, sick, strange person decided to stick it in against a robot from robot wars... WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO AN INNOCENT PLEO? I advice that you watch this only if you have a strong nervous disposition:

I am still shocked.

If anyone wants to get me a Pleo for my <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=pleo+dinosaur&LH_PrefLoc=2">birthday</a> you would be my friend for a very long time.
