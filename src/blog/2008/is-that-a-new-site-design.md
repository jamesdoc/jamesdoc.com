So rather than revising as I should be I've been working on my new website design to do after my exams are out of the way. I was round Gareth's last night and we were playing with ideas and designs for a new template on the left is my desig and Gareth's current design is here.

The basic idea is that the site replaces my current dying site which I haven't had time to do anything with to work out why the blog doesn't work or actually keep it up to date! I may even go and buy some real hosting and a proper domain name rather than using free hosting and a free domain!

If all goes to plan there will be a nice back end on the site so that I can log in and create posts or photo galleries that appear on the site as new posts. In addition to this there will be a couple of animated ideas, the navigation bar at the bottom slides in and out to give more screen space for the posts and the left and right arrows are used to flick between the blog entries.

My Twitter/Facebook status and Last.FM tracks are taken from the corrisponding RSS feed which should make the site feel more used. Then below are links to various websites that I use and interact with such as Facebook, Digg, Twitter, Wikipedia, etc.

If anyone has any comments on the design, etc please post them, would like to hear the comments and suggestions to improve it!
