**Kingdom Code BUILD is part of a global set of hackathons hosted by [Indigitous](https://indigitous.org/). During two weekend in October over 30 different cities of technologists come together to apply their skillsets.** We’re halfway through this year’s set of hackathons. Some happened last weekend, some will happen this weekend coming. Can I ask you to take a few minutes now to be praying for the impact of them?

These hackathon are taking place in cities around the world, from Auckland - New Zealand through to Abidjan – Côte d’Ivoire. Some hackathons, like the one happening this weekend in London, will have over a hundred people coming, others are small gatherings of three or four developers and designers. Regardless of the number of people in each room, over the course of these events, thousands of Christians working in the world of technology are coming together, giving up a weekend to offer their skills to serve the local and global church.

In these hackathons, ministry challenges which span many different areas of church ministry will be discussed, post-it notes will be scribbled on, solutions formed, laptops opened, and ideas will be transformed into designs and code that aim to carry on this great call that Jesus gives the church: _‘go and make disciples of all nations’_ (Matthew 28v19).

Some of these ideas will look like tools to help people encounter Jesus for the first time, others will be projects to help people get to know their local community better, or give stock control systems for Foodbanks, or manage personal finances, or improve family relationships. There are so many different directions that these projects will go in. _Will you pray that God would work within the teams this week to create projects that serve His church?_

As much as these events are about building tools that resource churches and ministries, these events are also unique times when technologists can meet with other Christians who work in the world of technology to explore together and see how the skillset that God has given can be used for His glory. In these weekends friendships form that serve to mentor, encourage and point each other to Christ. _Please pray that through these events strong Christ-centred friendships form that continue well beyond the hackathon?_

Kingdom Code is just one small part of a global movement of Christ-minded technologists seeking to use the skills that we have been given for God’s glory. Please pray that we will all continue to see our technology through the lens of our faith in Jesus.
