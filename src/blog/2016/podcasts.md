<p>Back in 2006 when I owned my first (and last) iPod* I started to listen to a couple of podcasts, I listened for a few weeks and then got bored of them, so stopped listening to podcasts. To be honest, until recently I thought that podcasts were a dead thing, that no one really used any more.</p><p>But after a conversation at work towards the end of last year I discovered that podcasts were still a thing, they were still being produced and actually being more popular than ever. Thank you <a target="_blank" href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a>.</p><p>At the beginning of January I decided to give the podcast thing a go again, and low and behold I’ve come to the conclusion that they might be the best new habit I’ve picked up this year…</p><p>I eased myself in slowly by starting with the podcast that <em>everyone</em> was talking about, the afore mentioned <a target="_blank" href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial podcast</a>, and have been adding new podcasts in each week.</p><p>One of the big things that has changed in my life that has made space to listen to these podcasts is a 40 minute cycle to and from work each day (on canal towpath, not busy London roads) which gives me a lot of time and space to listen to them. I’m actually finding I’ve got time to listen to a news report in the morning, getting to grips with some of the world news, or now can have a vaguely informed conversation around film rather than what I’m picking up off Twitter.</p><p>It turns out that there are a lot of apps for Android that do podcasts, a few that are free, and even less that are free and good. When I started out on this podcast journey I wasn’t sure if I wanted to invest in anything. So right now I am using <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast &amp; Radio Addict</a> which ticks the free and usable box, a little bit of a clunky interface, but I’ll forgive a lot for free. That said, now I have validated that this is more than just a whim, I am considering paying a whole £2.49 for the <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts&amp;hl=en">Pocket Casts</a> app.</p><p><strong>On the list at the moment (in alphabetial order)</strong>:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/beyondtheroundabout">Beyond the Roundabout</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.esv.org/resources/reading-plans/">ESV Bible Daily Readings</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/richardsargeant">Faith in Action</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvdrj">Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/techweekly">Tech Weekly</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtl3">The World Tonight</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech">This Week in Tech</a></li></ul><p>Some of these podcasts I am convinced will stay there for a long time (ESV, Kermode and Mayo, Serial &amp; The World Tonight), others I am just trying out at the moment.</p><small><em>My 5.5G iPod still works great, and I have no need to replace it.</em></small>
