<p> I&#39;ve been trying to maintain a regular set of posts appearing on this blog for almost the whole of April. I set aside 10 minutes each day to get some of my thoughts out of my head and onto paper. Then another 5 minutes to type them up and give a tiny bit of editing. I didn&#39;t intend for it to become &#39;a thing&#39; but I&#39;m surprised that I&#39;ve managed to keep it going!</p><p> Sometimes I know fairly early in the day what I am going to scribble down, other times I have to really work at it. Today I had no ideas regarding what was going to come out.</p><p> At the beginning one of the hopes I had for this was to improve my writing, to help me focus what I write concisely, giving that I only had 10 minutes to get it on paper. Hopefully that is happening. One of the things I have noticed from it is that it has helped me to think things through a little bit more as I transfer the madness in my head to slightly more tangible and logical notes.</p><p> Writing things down seems to make them more real, more set, less wild and less likely to change.</p>
