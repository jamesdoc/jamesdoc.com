<p> Over the last two weeks I&#39;ve been signed off work to give some time and space for my collar boon to start healing. This has given me two weeks worth of free time where I was forbidden from working, and two weeks were I couldn&#39;t really use my right arm, and I certainly wasn&#39;t allowed on my bike. A significant part of that time was given over to push on with my reading list. In the time I got through the auto-biog of Anna Smith, read the Great Gatsby, Cloud Atlas and made very good progress with the first of the Song of Ice and Fire books - A Game of Thrones.</p><p> Today I&#39;ve extended the reading list after picking up a large box sets with the rest of the books that have been written so far in the series. Seven in total, each around 750 pages long. I think that I&#39;m going to be reading them for quite a long time to come! I just need to work out how they fit into the reading list, and my limited shelf space!</p>
