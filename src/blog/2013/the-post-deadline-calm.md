<p> That time after passing a deadline is always an odd one; on one hand there is that wonderful rest having worked crazy-hard to hit the targets, to get the work done on time. On the other hand it does seem to make everything else after feel really slow...</p><p> Yesterday was deadline day. Today is the post deadline calm. I&#39;ve done a fair amount of work today, I would even go as far as to say it was productive. Just not even close to being a productive as the last 10 days. As a result today has just felt slow.</p><p> I think there is an interesting balance to be found in the pace of work. I am certain that I would hit burnout very quickly if I kept on at the pace of the last two weeks, but I also think I would end up going mad if my pace was as slow as it has felt today!</p>
