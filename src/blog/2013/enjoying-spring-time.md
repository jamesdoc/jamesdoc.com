<p> Today I adjusted my cycle into work in light of the improving weather. Rather that taking the quickest route into town I detoured to allow myself to cycle alongside the river. The photo above was taken at Iffley Lock as I stopped to enjoy the signs of Spring.</p><p> It reminded me of how much I miss cycling for the sake of going on a ride. I used to spend afternoons or whole days cycling along the coast or other the South Downs, but since going to uni and now moving to Oxford I haven&#39;t really done anything like it.</p><p> There are lots of cycle routes all over Oxfordshire, I think one of the priorities for this summer will be to find some of them and just to get out to enjoy the ride.</p>
