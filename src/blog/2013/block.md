<p>I suppose this is what they call writer block then… I've been outputting almost a post a day for the last couple of months, however as soon as I offer to write something for something else… zap. All gone.<p>There are words but they just don't seem to fit, and sentences which don't really work well together. It is just plain frustrating. I can understand how it would drive some authors mad.<p>I'm writing this as a distraction now. I really should get on with what I'm supposed to be writing. Ahh hello procrastination my old friend. How did we get thought university essays together?
