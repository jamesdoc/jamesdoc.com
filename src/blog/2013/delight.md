<p> Delight. It is a word that is appearing a lot at the moment. It is an emotive word that brings together the ideas of joy, happiness, surprise. Lots of positive vibes.</p><p> When I was younger my mum used to buy, and then make, Butterscotch Angel Delight. It brought delight to a younger me with its buttery sweet taste. It would probably delight me still!</p><p> In the web design and user experience communities <a href="http://aarronwalter.com/">Arron Walters</a> and the Mailchimp team have been waving the banner for delighting users. If users find delight in the product that you offer they will enjoy using it, and therefore keep coming back to use it.</p><p> Last night I was at the evening service of <a href="http://standrewsoxford.org/">St. Andrews, Oxford</a>&nbsp;and delight was one of the key words that I picked out there too. One of the illustrations used was of the small things that we do that can bring delight to people, such as the unexpected gift of a cup of tea for a spouse or friend (this is assuming they enjoy tea). The motivation behind the gift, not to curry favour, but instead to bring the other person enjoyment.</p><p> The Bible says that God delights in his people (Psalm 147:11), in the same way we can delight in God (Psalm 37:4). <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/taste-see-articles/why-god-tells-us-he-delights-in-his-children">John Piper writes</a>: &#39;<em>At root, what God delights in about us is that we delight in him.</em>&#39; It&#39;s a fantastic picture.</p>
