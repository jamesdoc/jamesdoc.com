<p> At the moment most of my weekends seemed to be filled with travel. Today I spent about 4 hours on a coach travelling to Cambridge. Last weekend I spent a similar amount of time heading to Leeds. Next week I will be in Sherbourne, and coming up are trips to Milton Keynes, London and Edinburgh. I love travelling, seeing new places and doing new things. But going for the new experiences is rarely the reason I go.</p><p> These new things are great, however they are made special by the people who are there with me. these people are friends and family, some who I have known for years, and others I am only just getting to know. Building any relationship comes as a result of going out of our way to make time for each other and sharing experiences together. It is something that I really value.</p><p> <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/write-now">On Monday</a> I asked the question of what are the things that are important to me. Spending quality time with friends is certainly up near the top.</p>
