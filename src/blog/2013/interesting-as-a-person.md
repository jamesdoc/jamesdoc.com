<p> It was remarked over the weekend that my high volume of blogging has dipped back to infrequent. During my week in Edinburgh I had a lower access to blog writing tools, so I pretty much stopped. Having broken the habit of putting some words on a page during lunch I didn&#39;t think to pick it back up when I came back. However, I am hopeful that I will be able to start to replace this in the coming weeks.</p><p> Today I am enjoying my recent purchase of a small green teapot, that is now residing on my office desk. I managed to find it in a charity shop for a couple of quid and it is producing much improved tea. So much better than brewing in the cup. It joins a fine collection on my desk which includes a plastic Jesus (star of a <a href="http://uncover.org.uk/f" target="_blank">UCCF Uncover video</a>), the penguin of death, a meerkat and Freddie the Mailchimp mascot. It is a good collection!</p><p> Today a colleague told me &quot;<em>you are so interesting, as a person</em>&quot;. I think this is long hand for &quot;<em>you are odd</em>&quot;. I cannot think why they would say that.</p>
