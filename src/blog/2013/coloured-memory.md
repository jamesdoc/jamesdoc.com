<p> One of the notes I scribbled down earlier for this post went something along time lines of &#39;I could have done without this week&#39;. This week has been full of frustration, late nights, bad rest, lots that I really didn&#39;t enjoy. It is easy to look back on it and wish that it didn&#39;t happen.</p><p> However, as I was reflecting on this, and the week that had past, I realised that there was so much in this week gone that was really great; catching up with friends per haggis, getting into Oxford centre stupidly early in the morning for the May Morning celebrations, some really great weather. Those things really are not skippable.</p><p> It is sad how I find that negative things colour, and often out-weigh the good things from my mind. I think in-part it is an attitude thing - if I let my mind dwell on the negative, or if I leave the negative unresolved then they are going to come to the forefront of my memory.</p><p> I think that is one of the reasons why Paul finishes his letter to the Philippian&nbsp;church by saying &#39;<em>whatever is good, true, honourable, just, pure, lovely, commendable, has excellence, is worthy of praise, think about these things</em>&#39; (4:8 roughly).</p><p> Onwards?</p>
