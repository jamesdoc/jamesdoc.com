<blockquote> <p> Control + Shift + Eject.</p></blockquote><p> For some reason this shortcut never managed to commit itself to my memory. As a result I always have to trawl Google searching for <em>&rsquo;OS X keyboard shortcut to lock screen&rsquo;</em>.</p><p> It is also advised in System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy you set <em>Require password</em> to be immediate.</p><p> In Windows you can [Windows Key + L] and in many flavours of Linux you can [Ctrl + Alt + L] or type something into the terminal.</p>
