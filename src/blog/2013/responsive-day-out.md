<p> I&#39;m just back from the <a href="http://responsiveconf.com/">Responsive Day Out</a> organsied by the wonderful folk at Clearleft. I&#39;m feeling inspired, energised and at the same time very tired! There was a lot crammed into the day.</p><p> There will be videos and audio recordings avalible at some point in the near future, so look out for them. However in the time in between <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bqy9jw1808v9ffs/kkY_G1IeYr">my notes are avalible on my Dropbox</a>. Please be aware that at the time of writing they are entirely unchecked, unedited, etc.</p><p> My notes for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bqy9jw1808v9ffs/V3Ne67HBSR/RDO.03.Cutting-the-mustard.md">Cutting the Mustard</a> are pretty slim, that is probably because it was one of the best talk - going through the RWD process for the BBC News site. When the video goes up, check that out!</p><p> I&#39;ve got a lot of work to do as a result of this day, however first step will be getting a good night sleep!</p><p> ---</p><p> <span>On a small tangental note - Dropbox has support for reading Markdown script. This is brilliant.</span></p>
