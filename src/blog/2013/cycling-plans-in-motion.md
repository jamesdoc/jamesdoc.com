<p> Ages ago I remember being told that &#39;<em>ideas are cheap</em>&#39;. Ideas come and go quickly. To often for me that is where they stay, as ideas. Rarely do I actually kick those ideas into the real world. Yesterday I put into action something that I had been thinking about for a couple of weeks - taking a week in July and go cycling around bits of Scotland.</p><p> One of the things I realise is that it is a bad idea just to jump into this without preparation. Independently of the Scotland idea I had set myself the goal of doing 500km in the month of May. <a href="http://app.strava.com/athletes/jamesdoc" target="_blank">Strava tells me</a> that in the last 9 days I&#39;ve reached 196km, so I am thinking that I may have to push the target a bit, and at the same time do more longer rides.</p><p> During my time in Scotland I will be based in Edinburgh. I know that one of the rides will be out to visit <a href="http://www.thefalkirkwheel.co.uk/" target="_blank">the Falkirk Wheel</a>, however the other rides have yet to be determined. Ideas, suggestions and recommendations are welcome!</p><hr /><p> Re: <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/on-print-design" target="_blank">Yesterday&#39;s post</a>.</p><p> It would appear that my initial fear of the print work coming back today was unfounded. A large box full of flyers arrived today all looking good. You can see them on my <a href="http://jamesdoc.dunked.com/world-student-day" target="_blank">Dunked Portfolio</a>.</p>
