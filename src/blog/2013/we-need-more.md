<p> My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/adamjeske" target="_blank">Adam</a> just posted a list of <a href="http://www.executingideas.com/2013/06/27-things-that-we-need-more-of/" target="_blank">27 things we need more of</a>. It ranges from slightly silly (but fantastic) things such as paddleboats and tree houses to more serious things like needing more listening and needing more hope. The first thing on the list was eye contact. This stood out to me because it&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve heard that being said this week.</p><p> One of the things that Mohammed said in his <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/tedxbrum" target="_blank">TEDxBrum talk</a> was that &quot;<em>...we&#39;re loosing the ability to engage with each other, we&#39;re too busy flicking at screens in our own little bubble</em>&quot; (<a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s18/sh/144d4ae5-2fea-4e36-98bc-5e52621600dc/601fa9406591a951820c0fecb4e15b1f" target="_blank">read all the notes</a>). It sounds familiar. We&#39;ve lost the ability to look at strangers on the train and have a conversation. Instead, we prefer the comfort of a screen flicking through Facebook and Twitter, or just zoning out listening to whatever is on our mp3 player.</p><p> We need more eye contact because that is the start of a conversation. It is the start of hearing things from a fresh perspective. It is the start of building a new relationship. It is the start of new thoughts and ideas. It&#39;s not something to miss out on.</p>
