<p> If you have been following my twitter updates over the last couple of weeks you may have noticed a variety of design related posted. I think most of these updates were either moaning about doing design work and not really feeling skilled for the job, or moaning that I was doing print design and <em>really</em> not feeling up for the job!</p><p> Tomorrow the designs come back from the printers, just in time for the IFES Senior Leadership Team meetings. I&#39;ve been told that the proofs all look fine, however that doesn&#39;t remove a certain amount of nervousness about seeing the designs on paper.</p><p> One of the things I love about the web is that if/when you see a mistake you can quickly correct it there and then. It really doesn&#39;t work that way with print; once it is printed it is forever immortalised on the page.</p><p> Tomorrow is the day of judgement! Maybe I&#39;ll be able to add print design to my jack-of-all-skills digital communication role&hellip; or maybe I&#39;ll be able to run away from print and back to the internet!</p>
