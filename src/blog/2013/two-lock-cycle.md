<p> A comment that is often made about the British is our love of talking about the weather. This is because, unlike so many other places around the world, our weather is so changeable. It goes from hot to not so hot, sunny to rainy in the blink of an eye. So far, May has been very consistent with it&#39;s weather, and that is pleasing.</p><p> Making the most of the warm morning I extended my route into work this morning, jumping from an 8km ride to a 13.5km ride. This route now takes me further out of Oxford, allowing me more time to cycle along the river.</p><p> The previous route took me through Temple Cowley and I joined the river at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iffley_Lock" target="_blank">Iffley Lock</a>, now I cross it at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandford_Lock" target="_blank">Sandford Lock</a>, follow a short cycle path before rejoining the river before the ring road. The slight drawback is that there is more cycling around the ring road than I would really like. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to adjust that tomorrow though!</p>
