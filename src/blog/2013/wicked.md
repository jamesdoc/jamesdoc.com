<p> Yesterday was my sister&#39;s birthday, so a surprise for her I took her to see Wicked today. I had asked Mum and Dad to ensure she kept today clear, and told no more. I think the surprise was kept right up until we reached the doors of the Apollo Theatre.</p><p> I really enjoy the theatre, specifically musicals and fortunately we share similar tastes over certain things, so I was pretty confident with this surprise.</p><p> It has been one of my favourite musicals for quite some time, I was trying to pin down why Wicked is so good&hellip;</p><ul> <li> Good adaption form the book, impressive to do considering the massive constraints.</li> <li> Incredibles songs that have both good lyrical content, music and musicians to perform them.</li> <li> Massive set and costume design that is regularly changing.</li></ul><p> I&#39;m beginning to sound a little too much like a fanboy for this blog so I&#39;m going to stop. I may have to do a proper review of the musical at some point.</p>
