<p> This weekend managed to have the perfect weather for a bank holiday weekend; hot (but not too hot), dry and cloudless. Room for an afternoon BBQ, catching up with friends, an evening cycle and just generally enjoying that extra day of not really having to do any work.</p><p> I&#39;m not back at my desk, trying to cram far too much into too little time, but that seems like a return to normality. I think the lesson is to make good use of the quiet times, rest well, enjoy it, and then hit the ground running on Tuesday.</p><p> I kind of want another bank holiday though, how about one at the end of May...</p>
