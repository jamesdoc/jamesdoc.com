<p> In less than a week I will be in Edinburgh. For a holiday. A time of rest. &nbsp;That I&#39;ve actually planned and stuff (rather than having time off <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/i-broke-myself" target="_blank">surprisingly thrown on me</a>).</p><p> The original plan was to go cycling, however that was thrown off by the afore-mentioned time off. Currently I have plans to catch up with friends, meet a couple of people from the internet, and then to generally be a tourist and then to rest and read.</p><p> So I have a question for you internet: what are the things that I must must must do while in Edinburgh? I&#39;ve got a trip to Glasgow on the cards, I foresee some walking near lochs, anyone want to offer suggestions? Places to see? Things to do? Great coffee shops?</p>
