<p> One of the big news items from last few days have been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10364876" target="_blank">the death of Margaret Thatcher</a>. In certain parts of the UK, and generally online, there have been upsetting reactions to Thatcher&#39;s death; <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22066540" target="_blank">celebration</a>. It triggers memories from Bin Laden&#39;s death where many people took to the streets in celebration.</p><p> I was only alive for a couple of months during Thatcher&#39;s time as prime minister. I don&#39;t have any right to comment on her time as leader having not lived through it, but regardless of your political views I do not see how it is right to celebrate someone&#39;s death.</p><p> Andy Shudall shared some helpful thoughts of Facebook earlier:</p><blockquote> <p> I rejoiced when Margaret Thatcher lost her leadership of the UK Conservative party and was ousted from being Prime Minister as a result of her own harsh ethos. I will not, however, rejoice in her death - human life, all human life, is too precious to be turned into a circus of love and hate as someone passes into eternity. Love her or hate her - you too will pass into eternity. Don&#39;t fear what people might say on your passing, fear more the judgement that awaits you once you have passed through death into eternity.</p></blockquote>
