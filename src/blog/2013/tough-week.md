<p> Work has been tough this week. A friend of mine describes these times as &#39;Genesis 3 periods&#39;, periods in your work when it is hard, and all you feel you have to show for it are brambles and weeds. The negative vibes that result <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/coloured-memory" target="_blank">colours everything</a>, and it is just difficult to see past them.</p><p> The challenge this week has been to remember that is is only a season, a short period, that there is light approaching and that I really really don&#39;t need to entertain the idea of getting a new job... because the grass <em>is </em>always greener, right?</p><p> As I think back through some of the frustrations of this week it is interesting where I naturally try and put the blame, I try and deflect a lot of it onto other people, because they have done something, or made a decision I didn&#39;t agree with, or whatever. However if really push past a lot of it, a fair amount of my frustrations have been self inflicted <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/castle-building" target="_blank">castle building</a> because I think that I&#39;ve got the perfect answer. Pride simply isn&#39;t helpful to my life, it makes work unpleasant and that in turn makes me unpleasant.</p><p> Onwards to next week.</p>
