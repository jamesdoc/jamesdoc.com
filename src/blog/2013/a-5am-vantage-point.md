<p> The weather in Oxford today is incredible, right from the very start at 5am we&#39;ve had an amazing blue sky (yes I did see 5am). It&#39;s really not the kind of day where you want to be stuck in an office, but that is where I am right now...</p><p> Today I released that I&#39;ve got used to Oxford, I overlook it&#39;s architecture, it&#39;s history, it&#39;s look and feel. It is now very easy to cycle down the high street and just take for granted what I&#39;m cycling past, how beautiful the city and surrounding area is. Recently I&#39;ve rediscovered the countryside around Oxford as I have been cycling further out. Today I rediscovered the beauty from the inside.</p><p> This morning, May 1st, I took part in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Morning" target="_blank">May Morning celebrations</a> that are traditional within Oxford. Rising early (that&#39;s the 5am part) and joining many of the residents in the city centre, I spent a lot of the morning just enjoying watching the sun rise up about the buildings. Over lunch today I escaped the office for a short while, climbed out of a window on the roof, and just sat looking out across some of the Oxford skyscape while working my way though a sandwich.</p><p> Sometimes it just takes a new perspective, seeing things from a different vantage point, to remind you of the things you so easily miss.</p>
