<p> My <a href="http://getpebble.com/">Pebble</a>&nbsp;finally arrived at work today. Having backed the project via KickStarter in May last year I was almost beginning to believe I would never see the thing!</p><p> I&#39;ll write a proper review of the watch next week, once I&#39;ve had more time to play with it, but the initial impressions are positive! There is already an impressive set of watch faces available from the development community, including an LCARS (Star Trek) face and a Polar Clock face, the latter probably being one of my favourites.</p><p> One of the side effects of having it on my wrists is that I have found myself absent-mindedly checking the time more often than I used to! The time is so pretty.</p>
