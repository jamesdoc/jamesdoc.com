<p>Having had an appointment in the diary for six weeks, with a precise time given for arrival, I was entirely unsurprised to find that the hospital were stating that there were 103 patients in the queue and that the waiting time would be between one to two hours. I think an improved system would involve logging a time of appointment and then telling the patient a time between 45 minutes and one hour after the recorded time. That way they only waste 15-30 minutes in the hospital waiting room rather than one to two hours</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a radical idea? It might solve waiting room congestion, and reduce the demand for out of date magazines. I took my own out of date magazine so I was spared the fight over a two year old copy of Hello...</p>
<p>In other news I have been discharged from the Trauma Clinic after breaking my collar bone. I'll try not to do it again.</p>
