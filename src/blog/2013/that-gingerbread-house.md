<p> I&rsquo;m in the process of moving to London. I&rsquo;m thinking about boring things like packing boxes, and telling my bank I&rsquo;ve changed address.</p><p> In a bit of downtime yesterday, I had this brilliant idea: an Ikea branded gingerbread house. It would be great - it fits so well with their brand. They are well known for their flat pack furniture with <em>helpful</em> assembly manuals. And for some reason their food seems to be very popular at the moment - who hasn&rsquo;t heard of their meatballs?</p><p> So why not combine the two together? Flat pack food.</p><p> Imagine kids constructing it with parents! It is kind of like a food construction toy. It would totally sell out, especially over Christmas.</p><p> Maybe that is why they beat me to it. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/90218783/">Pepparkaka Hus</a> and you can pick it up for &pound;2.20.</p><p> I might be visiting Ikea for some shelves soon, I think I&rsquo;ll be picking this up too.</p><p> Ideas are still cheap. I&rsquo;ll get back to moving house. And learning Python.</p>
