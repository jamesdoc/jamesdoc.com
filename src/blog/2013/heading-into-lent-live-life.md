<p>Today we prepared for Lent in the IFES office by eating lots of pancakes for lunch, it was tasty!</p><p>You may remember this time last year I took part in reLENTless, a set of six challenges over the lent period to explore more about the idea of sacrifice. This year I&#39;m doing it again.</p><p>World Vision Acts and IFES are exploring John 10:10:</p><blockquote><p> "... I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."</p></blockquote><p> What does Jesus mean when he says life and to the full? And how does that practically look like in my life?</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1TE2uTy8So" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p> If you are interested in doing Live Life with me, or just curious, head over to the <a href="http://livelife.worldvisionyouth.org/" target="_blank">World Vision site</a> to find out more and sign up.</p>
