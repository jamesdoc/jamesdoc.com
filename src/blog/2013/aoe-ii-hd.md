<p> This evening was spent doing something that I spend a fair amount of my teenage years doing - play Age of Empires II. It was re-released lat month with updated HD graphics and plugged into Steam, so it seemed only logical to pick it up!</p><p> There is only so much fun you can have playing against the AI, so it was good this evening to pick a fight with a couple of colleagues tonight. Or as Ollie put it:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Age of Empires HD. Nerd time with @<a href="https://twitter.com/jamesdoc">jamesdoc</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/davidgholland">davidgholland</a>.</p>&mdash; Ollie Brown (@olvrbrown) <a href="https://twitter.com/olvrbrown/status/334030829623853056">May 13, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p> Yes, it&#39;s a little bit nerdy to spend an evening playing computer games, but sociable and fun, so I&#39;ll take that! I have a feeling that it may become a semi-regular thing, so if anyone wants to join in please let me know!</p>
