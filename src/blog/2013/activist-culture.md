<p> In the life of my church in Oxford there is a lot going on. We had a meeting last night to hear some thoughts about one of the project and it was really exciting to hear and see it is moving forward. Drawing to the end of the meeting one of the church members, Tom, stood up to say something that really struck a chord with me:</p><blockquote> <p> In our activist culture how do we make time for prayer?</p></blockquote><p> He said a lot more, but I think this bit jumped out at me because I am someone who likes to be active, to be doing things. More often I spend my time doing, rather than sitting down and taking the time to plan things out. I prefer to see the result of what I am doing straight away. Perhaps this is one of the reasons I find prayer and personal devotion really tough to do.</p><p> Tom&#39;s reminder at the end of the meeting is really important, both for church and for me personally. There is a lot going on and we need to be running with God to achieve all that He is calling us to do.</p><blockquote> <p> Unless the Lord builds the house the builder labour in vain...<br /> <a href="https://www.youversion.com/en-GB/bible/113/psa.127.1.nivuk"><cite>Psalm 127:1a</cite></a></p></blockquote><div> &nbsp;</div>
