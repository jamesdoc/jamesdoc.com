<p> Catching up with old friends is always a great joy. Over the last two weekends I&#39;ve done a lot of it, and it is so good! One of the things pointed out two me was that a sign of a good friendship is regardless of the time spent apart, the ability o pick up where you left off is defining.</p><p> I&#39;ve been able to talk, laugh, and generally share life with some really great people. Catch up on what has been happening, reminisce on the time we spent together, relive old jokes, talk about the future, get some really helpful advice.</p><p> One of the things I always say after catching up with many people all in one go is that &#39;we must not leave it as long next time&#39;. We invariably do though. It is tough finding the space in the middle of busy lives, separated by many miles and responsibilities. But often it only takes an occasion, an event, or one person&#39;s crazy plan, and it is always worth it.</p>
