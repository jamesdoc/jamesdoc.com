<p> Yesterday I suffered a mistake I had made a while ago. On Sunday I was supposed to be in Sherbourne for the dedication of my second cousin, however due to lack of trains leaving Oxford in the time scale I needed I wasn&#39;t able to attend. If I had the forethought to actually look at train times in advances I would have been able to make arrangements around itâ€¦ but I didn&#39;t.</p><p> These kind of mistakes really get at me, firstly because I missed an important family event, and secondly because it could so easily have been avoided.</p><p> I&#39;ve just done through my diary for the next couple of weeks noting several of the big things coming up, all of which I have yet to sort out travel for. I need to fix this.</p><p> But this applies to so much more than just planning travel for events, there is a lot that I tend to run into without doing much ground work, and as a result often they fail to take off in the way I hope for. I need to fix that too.</p>
