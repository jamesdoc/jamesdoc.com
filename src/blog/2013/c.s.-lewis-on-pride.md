<p> I&#39;ve been reading through Tim Keller&#39;s book Every Good Endevour and he has just thrown in this challenging quote about pride:</p><blockquote> <p> &quot;Now what you want to get clear it that Pride is essentially competitive &ndash; is competitive by its very nature &ndash; while the other vices are competitive only, so to speak, by accident. Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. We say that people are proud of being rich, or clever, or good-looking, but they are not. They are proud of being richer, or cleverer, or better-looking than others&quot;</p> <p> <cite>C.S. Lewis - Mere Christianity</cite></p></blockquote>
