<p> I have just gone for a run. Not the &#39;argh, I am going to miss the train/bus&#39; kind of run, but instead the &#39;run in the park&#39; kind of run. This is odd.</p><p> I&#39;m in Edinburgh, taking a week holiday, the original plan had been to spend the week cycling, however a bust collar bone has push that back for a while. So instead of getting to see Edinburgh by saddle I figured I would spend some of my early morning going for a run.</p><p> The major discovery of this morning is that I actually can run. Not fast, but I did manage to get around Arthur&#39;s Seat (six km) in 35 minutes. Not only did I make it round, I was expecting to end up walking the final three quarters, I was managing to overtake some people once I had found a pace.</p><p> This raises a new problem now, if I keep this running up and the cycling, I am two thirds of the way into triathlon territory. Several people have been trying to encourage me to do this... I&#39;m going to ignore them for a little longer though.</p>
