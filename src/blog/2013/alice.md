<p> One of my favourite set of books is Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass. They are completely off the wall and funny, but have a point at the same time.</p><p> I also love the way that many other authors have taken the books, written by Lewis Carroll, and then adapted them into their own take on the story. Several years ago I read a book by Frank Beddor called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1405219769/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1405219769&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jamdoc-21" target="_blank">The Looking Glass Wars</a> which painted a war-torn Wonderland where the main character, Alyss, was trapped in our world, SyFy put <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004JRQ0ZE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004JRQ0ZE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jamdoc-21" target="_blank">their spin on the books</a> in a mini-series which put a science fiction spin on the books. &nbsp;Recently in the cinema we had <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0033WRUN2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0033WRUN2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jamdoc-21" target="_blank">Tim Burton&#39;s Alice in Wonderland</a> which simply was very Tim Burton.</p><p> Today I spotted another version that is coming curtesy of ABC called Once Upon a Time in Wonderland which puts Alice into a Victorian setting, however in a hospital as doctors try to cure her delusional memories of Wonderland.</p><p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AxtzXOaYiwI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p> It looks like a really interesting concept, I hoping that it will be repeated at some point in the UK.</p>
