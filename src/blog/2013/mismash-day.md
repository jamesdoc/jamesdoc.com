<p> In an unlikely turn of event I am making my daily scribbling after work, rather than during my lunch break. Over lunch I enjoyed the company of a good friend and consequently had to run back to be at work in time for a meeting. Good fun!</p><p> Today has been one of those days with a mis-mash of different jobs to get done, which ranged from bug fixing an issue within the CMS, designing an email template and having a meeting with Oxford Cartographers. The cartography and mapping element of my work at the moment was something I really didn&#39;t see coming when I started working here!</p><p> This evening is going to be spent being cultured; watching a Spanish play called <a href="https://vimeo.com/63316113" target="_blank">La vida es sue&ntilde;o</a> (Life is a Dream). Fortunately it will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtitles" target="_blank">surtitled</a> - my Spanish is as good as my French. I&#39;m sure it will be an interesting event...</p>
