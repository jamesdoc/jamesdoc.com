<p> Last night I put up a <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/c.s.-lewis-on-pride" target="_blank">C.S. Lewis quote on the blog</a>, it was pulled out of the book I am reading with a couple of blokes from church; <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1444702599/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1444702599&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jamdoc-21" target="_blank">Every Good Endeavour by Tim Keller</a>. The book is about about the ethics of works, it has the tag line - &#39;<em>Connecting your work to God&#39;s plan for the world</em>&#39;. No small challenge.</p><p> The two chapters we were looking today were about the selfishness that can creep into our work; our desire to make a name for ourselves and then to find security, worth and value in that, rather than looking to find that in God. It is there that the C.S. Lewis quote fits in - if I build my identity on my skills, the projects I am working on, etc then I am always going to be proud of my own tower. Then when someone criticises it, or builds a bigger, better tower then I get knocked down. It is a dangerous game to play, because the pleasure is only short lived.</p><p> I believe that the things I am good at, the things I enjoy, the job I have are gifts that God has given to me. While I have worked at them, I have used the talents that I cannot take credit from. I must therefore believe that I have been given them for a reason.</p><p> Right now I am wondering if I am using what I have been given well, or if I am just castle building...</p>
