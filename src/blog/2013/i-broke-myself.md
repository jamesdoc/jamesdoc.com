<p> I broke myself today. Well, specifically I have broken my collar bone. It wasn&#39;t smart or clever, but it happened. Personally I am impressed that after 22 years this is the first bone I have broken, it is apparently one of the worst ones to break.</p><p> You cannot just stick a cast on it. So instead I&#39;m in a TARDIS coloured sling attempting to type with one hand... it is not great!</p><p> This has also scuppered several bigger plans... I have been told that I will be in the sling for another six weeks, and the healing process will take up to six months. This also means that I&#39;m going to be off my bike for an extended period, so I have missed my 500km goal for May by 15km, and the big plan to cycle in Edinburgh is going to have to be put on ice for the immediate future.</p><p> I looked back at my recording of the ride and discovered that I came off at about 55km/h, and judging my the dent in my helmet it could have been a lot worse... Lesson of today, take bends on hills a bit slower.</p>
