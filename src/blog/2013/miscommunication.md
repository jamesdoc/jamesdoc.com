<p> Over lunch I&#39;ve was thinking about miscommunication. In my life most miscommunication is rarely as a result of what is said, but instead how it is said...</p><p> I&#39;ve noticed that Twitter is full of miscommunication because often it is too short - the communication is direct and brief, rarely giving opportunity to flesh out response. Sometimes it is the lack of communicated emotion - something is said in jest which is missed. Other times this is reversed and it actually the presence of strong emotion that colours the entire communication.</p><p> In these events what matters is what happens next. How is the miscommunication resolved? And how do we prevent it from happening again? This solves a lot of future problems. It takes time, it involves building relationships and it involves learning to say sorry.</p>
