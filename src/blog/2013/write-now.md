<p> Current status: In IFES Monday morning prayer. We&#39;ve been challenged to spend 7 minutes writing. Like an Englishman my first thoughts are towards the weather - grey sky, but warmer than it has been.</p><p> We&#39;ve just been going through what is going on this week as a team. It seems that there is a lot going on this week. Will be busy. Plenty to pull my attention.</p><p> Yesterday on the train back from Leeds I was thinking about my desire to improve my skill set, specifically to learning more about design and the principles behind it. Today I am wondering how I can fit it all into a busy schedule.</p><p> Making good use of my time is an easy thing to say, but it is harder to put into practice...</p><p> I think the first step is to work out what is important in my life. What are things that really matter to me? If I can work them out maybe I can run towards them with focus.</p><p> These last few minutes showed one specific thing - make space.</p>
