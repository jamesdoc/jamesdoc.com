<p> After the <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2015/06/lastpass-security-notice.html/" target="_blank">LastPass security breach in June</a> I&#39;ve been meaning to change my method of securing my passwords. I had been put off KeePass because of the clunky mac client, however yesterday I discovered <a href="http://mstarke.github.io/MacPass/" target="_blank">MacPass</a> which turned that around for me.</p><p> It is still under a lot of development, however it has enabled me to get everything moved out of LastPass into a password vault that I own, rather than host on LastPass&#39; servers somewhere.</p><p> On Android I&#39;m using&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukaszgajos.keepassmob" target="_blank">KeePassMob</a>&nbsp;which works nicely too, plus has a lovely Material UI design.</p>
