<p>An extract from today's lunch time read.</p><blockquote> <p> It would seem that Christianity requires both emotional and intellectual assent. If there is only emotion, the mind asks troubling questions that, if not answered, might lead to a falling away, for love cannot be sustained without understanding. On the other hand, there is a gap which must be bridged by emotion. If one is suspicious of the upsurge of feeling that may be incipient faith, how is one to cross the gap?</p> <cite>- Sheldon Vanauken: A Severe Mercy (1977)</cite></blockquote>
