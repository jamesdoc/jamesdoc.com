<p> It has been a long while since I have had to worry about how much space I have for emails thanks to Gmail giving me a lot of free space. However that isn&rsquo;t the same for everyone; many people will still have restrictions on how much space on the email server they can take up. When setting up email accounts for clients using my web server I normally set the cap at about 1Gb.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve had a couple of emails recently telling me that a few of these people are rapidly approaching their limit, which was then followed up by a couple of emails from the client saying &ldquo;help, I don&rsquo;t know where all these emails are&rdquo;.</p><p> A little bit of research told me that Apple Mail could quite easily solve this quandary for me:</p><ol> <li> Set up the email account in Apple Mail</li> <li> Right click &lsquo;Inbox&rsquo; and select &lsquo;Account Info&rsquo;</li> <li> Read the graph!</li></ol><p> In my case all the space is been eaten by sent emails. Useful to know!</p>
