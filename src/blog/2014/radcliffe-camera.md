<p> I was in Oxford last night and snapped this photo of the Radcliffe Camera. This one has gone through a little bit of post-production, but still impressed at how well the Nexus 5 handles low light.</p><p> I&#39;ve put the full version on my Tumblr:<br /> <a href="http://thejamesdoc.tumblr.com/post/101878267372/radcliffe-camera-oxford">thejamesdoc.tumblr.com</a></p>
