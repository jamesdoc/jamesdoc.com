<p> Another year ends and a new one begins. This change happens so often, but this year for me brings more than just a change in final digit.</p><p> The emotions around this are conflicted. The new year is both exciting&hellip; and scary. A lot of 2013 must remain where it is- locked in 2013.</p><p> 2014 brings <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/i/vam.gif" target="_blank">a new job</a>. The new job provokes a move to <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/i/london.gif" target="_blank">London</a>. In turn, moving to London means finding a new church and building a new set of relationships.</p><p> So much change in such a short space in time. If you are the praying type I would appreciate it. Either way, give me a call some time, or drop in to see me; check that my head is still above water.</p>
