<p>This week the V&amp;A has been taken over by the <a href="http://www.londondesignfestival.com" target="_blank">London Design Festival</a>. Across the building are some wonderful installations across the building, including <a href="http://www.londondesignfestival.com/events/officine-panerai-collaborates-de-pass-montgomery-and-mcintyre" target="_blank">Candela</a> this entrancing, rotating wheel in the tapestry gallery. I&rsquo;ve spent a fair amount of time this week just enjoying the new patterns being created on phosphorescent disc.</p>
