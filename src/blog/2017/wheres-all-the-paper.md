title: Where's all the paper gone?
intro: Ahead of Kingdom Code's 2017 hackathon I shared some thoughts about paper on the Fusion blog.

I've got a confession to make… I don't think I actually read any of the books on my university reading list. At least not in 'physical book' form anyway. A required citation was just a PDF or eBook away. Paper hand-ins all but vanished, except from the printed dissertation) and my end of year results didn't come by post but came via email or SMS.

## University is Changing

University is changing because the world is changing. Data is easy to come-by and trivial to share and pass around. The reduced reliance on paper isn't just a university thing; we get our news via an app, wedding invitations by email.

And of course the church hasn't escaped either, hymn books have become projectors, news-sheets are now emails or Facebook posts.

But is that where it has to stop in the Christian world? We simply replace paper for a screen and call it quits? We put our leather-back bible in app-form, and our prayer list is replaced with a database. These things are useful, but hasn't technology proven to be more than that?

## Coding for the Kingdom

Last October, one of the winning teams at Kingdom Code: BUILD, a weekend challenge for developers, designers and entrepreneurs made BibleChat. It's a skill for Amazon Echo, rather than asking Alexa to read a verse, you ask what the Bible says about euthanasia or the meaning of life or being angry or love… It will speak a short answer with a relevant bible-verse.

You don't need to know anything about the paper bible to use it, to find an answer, to find hope, to find gospel truth.

## How can you be a digital missionary?

This year the Fusion Student Mission Awards have a category for digital mission. How can you live for Jesus in the online space? How can you be a digital missionary?

There are tools to help, but what if there is a tool in your head waiting to be made? A digital idea that could transform campus or share the gospel with someone who wouldn't have access another way? What could you and a team build in 48 hours?

Kingdom Code: BUILD is happening on the 20th to 22nd October in London. It's a weekend to learn, experiment and test digital ideas which can have a Kingdom impact. If you're a developer or digital designer this is a great opportunity to grow your skill-set, meet others working in that world and use your skill-set to push forward the great commission in the digital space.
