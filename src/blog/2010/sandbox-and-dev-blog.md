<p>I think I may have found a satisfactory use for the university blogging platform... rather than place updates about some of the more geeky work that I'm doing at uni I'm going to send them off to my all new <a href="http://jamesdoc.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/">university blog</a>.  From there you will be able to get information and links to the things that I am working on. &nbsp;I'll occasionally post some of the more exciting stuff here, however I figure that the core audience of this blog won't really have much use for some of the more technical stuff that I'm looking to post.</p>
<p>Today I've been playing around with <a href="http://posters.lincoln.ac.uk/">posters.lincoln.ac.uk</a> and I've placed a link to a <a href="http://jamesdoc.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2010/12/20/posters/">basic API</a>&nbsp;that I've put together for my Situated Display project on the blog.</p>
<p>Get all the info from&nbsp;<a href="http://jamesdoc.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/">jamesdoc.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/</a>.</p>
