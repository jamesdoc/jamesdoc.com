Now, I'm not one to jump at rumours the float around the Twitter Mill... however this one is looking pretty big at the moment, coming right out of the Twitter account of Kevin Max:

> Trying to get a DCT tour happening, perhaps next year, any of you down?

It sounds pretty serious! Back in 2000 DC Talk took an intermission to pursue solo careers; TobyMac joined up with the Diverse City band, Michael Tait started his own band called Tait and is now a signed up member of the Newsboys, and Kevin Max has released four albums, with another due this summer. 2011 would be the tenth year since the beginning of the hiatus.

During their 12 year span before going on a break in 2001 DC Talk released five albums, three of which went platinum, including Jesus Freak which in it's first month sold over 500,000 copies. As well as being very out spoken in their Christian message, the band also had a very strong anti-racism message which was made very clear in their song Coloured People.

It is probably to early to tell if anything will come of this, there have been no comments so far from either TobyMac or Tait. That said, I really want it to happen, DC Talk released some fantastic music while they were around, the individual solo careers from each member shows that they are still producing great music, it would be great to put them back together!
