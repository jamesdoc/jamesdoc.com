<a href="http://www.facebook.com/olitaylor">Oli Taylor</a> and I have been working on a bit of test footage for our Digital Special Effects course at the University of Lincoln.

The final idea will involve shooting people against a green screen and placing them on top of the cards, rather than the cool stick men. This is the basic idea, working out how to motion track and mask correctly in Adobe's After Effects. There is a lot of work still to go, but I'm loving it so far!
