However due to a whole load of uni assignments play time with my new toy is minimal at best, but I have had it out a bit...<br /><br />Here's the challenge:<br />The three photos below were taken by three different cameras:<br /><ul><li>Canon 20d</li><li>Canon IXUS 80</li><li>HTC Hero</li></ul>Which camera took which photo?
