I've just picked a Canon 20d off eBay. It is all very exciting! However due to a whole load of uni assignments play time with my new toy is minimal at best, but I have had it out a bit...

Here's the challenge:

The three photos below were taken by three different cameras:

- Canon 20d
- Canon IXUS 80
- HTC Hero

Which camera took which photo? Answers in the comments below!
