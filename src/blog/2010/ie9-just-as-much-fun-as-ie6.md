I've just had the pleasure of reading an article on the site CSS3 Wizardry talking about the subject of the latest incarnation of Internet Explorer; IE9. It is pretty quoteable, so much so that I'm going to try and drop a couple of them into my dissertation this year:

> "Firefox, Chrome and Safari can render graphically rich interfaces using the sophisticated features of CSS3. IE9 does, well, rounded corners."

> "As always, IE is years behind the other browsers. While the rest of the Web development community is going to the moon, Microsoft is inventing a bicycle... Enjoy your bicycle, Microsoft. I 'm going to keep exploring the universe in my Starship.

> "With IE9 you can keep making Websites like you did, um, back in 1995: lots of pieces of images chopped up and stuck all over the place like a jigsaw puzzle."

> "IE9 is the ugly, disfigured step-sister of the beauty queen browsers."

> "Now you know why Internet Explorer's E is blue: it represents how IE suffocates and strangles Web innovation."
