<p>I've just had the pleasure of reading an article on the site CSS3 Wizardry talking about the subject of the latest&nbsp;incarnation&nbsp;of Internet Explorer; IE9. It is pretty quoteable, so much so that I'm going to try and drop a couple of them into my&nbsp;dissertation&nbsp;this year:</p>
<blockquote>"Firefox, Chrome and Safari can render graphically rich interfaces using the sophisticated features of CSS3. IE9 does, well, rounded corners."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"As always, IE is years behind the other browsers. While the rest of the Web development community is going to the moon, Microsoft is inventing a bicycle... Enjoy your bicycle, Microsoft. I 'm going to keep exploring the universe in my Starship."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"With IE9 you can keep making Websites like you did, um, back in 1995: lots of pieces of images chopped up and stuck all over the place like a jigsaw puzzle."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"IE9 is the ugly, disfigured step-sister of the beauty queen browsers."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Now you know why Internet Explorer 's E is blue: it represents how IE suffocates and strangles Web innovation."</blockquote>
