<p>One of the modules I am doing this year is called Mobile and Social Computing.  This&nbsp;semester&nbsp;we've been making little Java applications to fulfil the mobile part. &nbsp;What my app does it give you information about your next lecture based on your University ID. For example, I'm told my next lecture is:</p>
<blockquote>Lecture: Mobile And Social Computing<br />Date: Monday 6th Dec - 11:00 am<br />Location: MHT: CompLab B 3204<br />Staff: Derek Foster</blockquote>
<p>Potentially pretty handy.</p>
<p>However I decided it was a little bit silly just to keep the app stuck in a Java application, so I've pulled it across into a web app as well. &nbsp;The design is taken from the University of Lincoln Common Web Design (CWD), which I can't claim credit for at all! &nbsp;The web app does the same thing as the Java app, just looking a lot more slick... and it has a big picture of a train on it.*</p>
<p>I'll be giving out a URL once the project gets handed in, there may even be a mobile web app version if you are really lucky, but for now if anyone wants to be part of the beta testing please get in touch!</p>

<small>* I did this at about 3:00am on Saturday. The logic was trains have timetables... don't judge me.</small>
