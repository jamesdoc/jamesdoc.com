I think we can all agree that at one point or another we've said; 'wouldn't it be great ifâ€¦' whilst watching a TV show. And this is something that the lead writer of Doctor Who, Steven Moffat, agrees with - "Children don't just watch Doctor Who - they join in. They make up games, invent their monsters, create their own stories."

Soon we'll be able to do just that, through the Doctor Who website in June, the BBC will be releasing four interactive computer games to allow the viewers to control how the Doctor Who story unfolds. Piers Wenger, the Executive Producer for Doctor Who, while talking about these new computer games said "There aren't 13 episodes of Doctor Who this year, there are 17 - four of which are interactive. Everything you see and experience within the game is part of the Doctor Who universe: we'll be taking you to places you've only ever dreamed about seeing - including locations impossible to create on television."

These four new stories will be an extension to the existing series, following the Doctor and Amy as they travel through time and space, moving from a desolate burning London to an ice world or a dark space ship. In these episodes the Doctor and Amy will meet the Daleks and Cybermen, alongside a several completely new aliens. The question is; will they be friend or foe?

The Doctor and Amy Pond have been recreated in 3d digital form, and Matt Smith and Karen Gillan have been in the recording studio to provide a voice over for their characters, alongside a full cast to provide voices for both the new and old characters. Murray Gold, who has written the music for the Eccleston, Tennant and Smith eras of Doctor Who has been commissioned to add a sound track and sound effects for the games.

At the moment the plot and titles of these new interactive stories are being kept secret, but with the pen of Steven Moffat (Blink, The Empty Child), Phil Ford (The Waters of Mars) and James Moran (Fires of Pompeii) you can guarantee a gripping and scary ride!

More screenshots from the games are currently on the Doctor Who website (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho">bbc.co.uk/doctorwho</a>). All four of the interactive episodes will be completely free for both Mac and PC, with the first episode being made available from the Doctor Who website in June 2010.

PS. While I would love to write a review of each Doctor Who episode, I just don't have time at the moment. The site Blogtor Who are writing reviews of each episode, and fair ones too.
