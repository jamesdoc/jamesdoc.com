A while back I wrote top five list of light weight Mac apps that everyone should be using. &nbsp;Right at the top of that list was a program called QuickSilver. &nbsp;Recently the developer of this program has been hired by Google and they released an app called Google Quick Search Box, a program to launch applications through the keyboard rather than navigating the start menu with the mouse; you trigger it with a pre-defined shortcut and then type the first couple of letters of the program you want and the program appear. &nbsp;Very handy if you are faster at typing that you are at using a mouse!<br /><br />Originally the Google Quick Search Box was only&nbsp;available&nbsp;for OS X computers, then Google bundled it with their Google Toolbar for Windows, which was nice because PC users could also have the launcher. &nbsp;However back in March it was removed from the Toolbar. &nbsp;At work I have been using Windows a lot recently, and having been missing it's features, so after a bit of searching and hunting, here is a five step guide to get Quick Search Box running in Windows again.<br /><ol><li>Download it! (<a href="http://dl.google.com/quick_search_box/1.2.1151.245/googlequicksearchboxsetup.exe">Click Me</a>)</li><li>Open up Command Prompt (Win+R and type 'cmd')</li><li>Navigate in Command Prompt to where the file is saved. eg: type 'CD C:/Users/JamesDoc/Downloads'</li><li>Type 'googlequicksearchboxsetup.exe /install /bundle=tbie /global /brand=GGLL /hl=en'</li><li>No step five!</li></ol><div>Quick Search will be installed and you will then be able to configure it from the little button that appeared on your start menu.</div><div><br /></div><div>Should you want to uninstall it, just follow the same steps, just replace step four with 'googlequicksearchboxsetup.exe /uninstall /bundle=tbie /global'<br /><br />Update - Jaime has pointed out that the command prompt must be running with administrator&nbsp;privileges&nbsp;first.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-6121780115949327203?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
