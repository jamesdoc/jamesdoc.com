Sorry for the lack of updating recently, with any luck service will resume to normal soon, it's safe to say that I have been quite busy with various bit of uni work, and things that can't really be called uni work!

On the uni work front I've had my head stuck in 3DS Max building a <a href="https://vimeo.com/11217995" target="#null">3D model angel</a> which is coming on quite well. The linked video isn't the finished product, there is a fair amount of work still to be done, reducing the number of polygons in the model being the primary one, and then adding a texture to it, but at the moment I'm pleased with how the angel is coming on! There will probably be various updates on this through my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jamesdoc">Twitter</a> or Facebook status!

Have a good week!
