Don't get me wrong, the built in screen savers to OS X are nice, flurry is pretty and the mosaic screen saver coming from iPhoto or Aperture is just fantastic. However it's quite nice to personalise your desktop experience beyond the basic.

One of the nice things about Linux operating systems is it's range of screen savers, admittedly some of these are a touch on the dull side, but some them are just fantastic; flying toasters or bouncing cows being a good example!

Now thanks to Dan @ UneasySilence these screen savers have been compiled for OS X 10.6 "<i>with 64 bit goodness.</i>" Now you too can download the screen savers that play nicely from <a href="http://uneasysilence.com/archive/2010/01/14685/">uneasysilence.com</a>. Personally I think that the screen saver Substrate is worth a look at.
