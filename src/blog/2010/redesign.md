I'm in the process of redesigning my website and blog, an early theme went online last week, and after some major rethinking the currently layout is the <a href="http://jamesdoc.blogspot.com/">design</a> that is going to stay in some form for the next year. There is a little more work to do with it, I am debating to allow colours, and the font design is still under review.

As ever if you have thoughts or comments please leave them below!
