Of late there have been several big phone announcements, the obvious iPhone announcements each year, Nokia released their N97, Palm put out the Pre and both Motorola and HTC have recently started selling their Android devices. Android has been a operating system created by Google open for any manufacturer to put onto their devices, so far it has been picked up by companies like HTC, Motorola, Samsung for phones, and has been taken on by Dell and Acer to produce notebooks.

So with the history lesson behind us yesterday Google, with the aid of HTC, announced the release of the Nexus One. While being built by HTC the design and the branding come straight from Google despite saying that they would be building hardware, and technically they haven't! The phone features a 1Ghz Snapdragon processor, 512Mb of RAM and will support up to 32Gb of microSD memory. Also in the machine is a 3.7" AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, a 5 megapixel camera and a battery that will supply unto 10 hours of 2g talk time.

One thing that is special to the Nexus One is the new idea of voice keyboard. It takes speech recognition and then for every text field in the phone allows you to say what you want typed, and every report that I have read has been singing it's praises, which is impressive as most voice recognition software that has been demoed by other companies normally <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1123221217782777472&amp;hl=en#" target="null">fails</a>!

While at the moment the Nexus One is only available in the US on a T-Mobile contract, but it should be heading over the waves to hit the UK with Vodaphone by Spring time.
