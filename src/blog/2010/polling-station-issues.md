<p>I'm staying up until at least the Lincoln result comes in at 2:30, and maybe if I'm feeling&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;keen to see the Worthing result at 5:00. &nbsp;This gives me some time to kill! As such I just wanted to take some time to comment on the debate about people being turned away from polling stations tonight.</p>
<p>For those who haven't been following, or just simply don't care; why are you reading this blog? But I'm going to tell you anyway. Basically a whole load of people turned up at various polling stations late and then when the station closed at 22:00 were refused entry. &nbsp;This caused uproar as people were being refused a vote in a significant election</p>
<p>My response to this is much the same as Simon Mayo, who said on his Twitter earlier:</p>
<blockquote>7am - 10pm. How much longer do people need?</blockquote>
<p>The polling stations have been open all day, it was clearly advertised how long they would be open, people simply should of been more organised, and got it sorted. &nbsp;On the other hand, what is unacceptable is certain polling stations running out of ballot papers before the close. &nbsp;I cannot understand how this can even happen, everyone who has registered surely should have a ballot paper printed?</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Electoral&nbsp;Commission has said that there will be an investigation into both issue, but it does mean that whatever the result at the end of the night a party or two will contest the result. &nbsp;As we stand at the moment Labour have 5 constituencies, the Lib Dems have 1, Conservatives have 0 and there are 3 other seats, with the exit polls looking towards a hung Conservative and Labour parliament.</p>
