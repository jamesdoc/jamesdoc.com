Back in July I posted that [a very nice company called Jetta had saved our friendly animatronic dinosaur, Pleo, from extinction](/blog/2009/pleo-back-from-the-grave/). Well the company have had a stand at CES, not a huge one but a stand none the less. They have been working on the G2 Pleo and Engadget are rumouring a giant Pleo as well?
