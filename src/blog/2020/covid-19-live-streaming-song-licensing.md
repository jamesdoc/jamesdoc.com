_In light of Covid-19 and lots of churches moving their services online I had a chat with [CCLI](https://uk.ccli.com/) and [PRS for music](https://www.prsformusic.com/) around the legalities of live streaming the sung worship in your church. What follows is my understanding of the situation… please note that I am **not** a copyright lawyer_.

**Too long… didn't read:**

- [Music in the public domain](https://songselect.ccli.com/search/results?List=publicdomain) is fair game. Do what you want with it.
- Your church worship leader is treated like a covers band by YouTube and Facebook. They have the license in place for you to livestream them.
- Streaming publically over other platforms is unclear, but you will probably need a [Limited Online Music Licence from PRS](https://www.prsformusic.com/licences/using-music-online/limited-online-music-licence).
- Livestreaming recordings (eg from the latest Hillsong album) is not okay.
- Displaying lyrics is not clear at the moment… however you probably need [CCLI's streaming license](https://uk.ccli.com/streaming/#need-to-know), unless you limit your worship to [music in the public domain](https://songselect.ccli.com/search/results?List=publicdomain) or those who [have given permission](https://covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk/livestreaming).

The short summary of my call - **If you are using streaming services like YouTube or Facebook live you're fine because they have paid the license for _user generated_ content.** This means that your church's band, organist, solo pianist, etc is treated like a covers band on these platforms. Playing 'covers' of the latest worship songs is permitted.

What you can't do is use commercially recorded music and sing over the top of it - don't livestream your church karaoke - that recording is copyrighted. If you want to stream recordings of songs (eg: a track from the latest Hillsong album) you’ll need to jump through some hoops with PRS ([unless the artist has given permission](https://covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk/livestreaming) - but even that is problematic because of automatic checking by YouTube and Facebook).

If you are using something other than Facebook or YouTube I would encourage you to double check the service provider's policy for such things. I know of a number of churches that are using services like Skype and Zoom, I doubt that they have that kind of license in place. Read on…

If you are using something like [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) or Skype, or if (for some reason) a technically competent member of your church built from scratch their own live streaming platform… PRS for Music has the [Limited Online Music Licence](https://www.prsformusic.com/licences/using-music-online/limited-online-music-licence), band A costs ~£150 year and should cover you, however [have a chat with PRS first](https://www.prsformusic.com/help/contact-us).

**Frustrating the same does not apply to displaying song lyrics.** This is a bit unclear, I think that you need to either:

- Limit yourself to [songs in the public domain](https://songselect.ccli.com/search/results?List=publicdomain)
- Get permission from directly from the licence holder. ([See a list of groups that I know have given permission](https://covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk/livestreaming)).
- Get the [CCLI streaming license](https://uk.ccli.com/streaming/#need-to-know). It's not actually clear what this covers, but their website does have the friendly heading _'Relax, You're Covered'_. So that's good right?

**For all other questions related to the church and Coronavirus there is [a growing Google Doc](http://covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk/) that is being put together by a number of excellent and trusted friends: [covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk](http://covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk/).**

\*Nb: Strong disclaimer here: I'm not a lawyer, I'm just someone who had a couple of phone calls over lunch. I'll update this post if my understanding of the situation changes.
