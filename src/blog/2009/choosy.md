A while back I posted a list of [five free apps that I couldn't live without](/blog/2009/five-very-simple-os-x-applications-that-are-awesomely-useful/). Choosy is one of those apps that I can't live without, unfortunately it isn't freeâ€¦ however I'll get to that later!

I use lots of browsers on my computer, partly because I need to test some of my web designs in other browsers, partly because I have a browser commitment phobia! Basically what Choosy does is to give you an option as to which browser you want to use when you click a link from a program, this in itself is very useful, however it gets better!

The final release of Choosy also contains a way of setting up rules, so that you can tell the link facebook.com to always open in a certain browser, or any link from a certain program to open in another browser, stunningly useful, especially seeing as I can tell youtube.com never to open in Chrome!

As I said above Choosy isn't free, you can try it for 45 days for free, however after that it costs \$12 which, at the time of writing, is about &pound;7ish! But, if you use my nice discount code "<i>UGBXP"</i> you can get 15% off!

You can find out more, see videos and actually download Choosy from <a href="https://choosyosx.com">choosyosx.com</a>.
