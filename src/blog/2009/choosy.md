Choosy is one of those apps that I can't live without, unfortunately it isn't free... however I'll get to that later!<br /><br />I use lots of browsers on my computer, partly because I need to test some of my web designs in other browsers, partly because I have a browser commitment phobia!  Basically what Choosy does is to give you an option as to which browser you want to use when you click a link from a program, this in itself is very useful, however it gets better!<br /><br />The final release of Choosy also contains a way of setting up rules, so that you can tell the link facebook.com to always open in a certain browser, or any link from a certain program to open in another browser, stunningly useful, especially seeing as I can tell youtube.com never to open in Chrome!<br /><br />As I said above Choosy isn't free, you can try it for 45 days for free, however after that it costs $12 which, at the time of writing, is about &pound;7ish!  But, if you use my nice discount code "<i>UGBXP"</i> you can get 15% off!<br /><br />You can find out more, see videos and actually download Choosy from <a href="http://www.choosyox.com/">www.choosyox.com</a><br /><div><span style="font-family:'Lucida Grande';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue';"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><br /></span></span></span></span></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-4841643808146067932?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
