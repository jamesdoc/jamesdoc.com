<p>I think that the following week is going to be one that is rather busy and full!  My church in Worthing is just coming to the end of a phase of massive building work and is being shown to the community on Saturday coming, which is very exciting.  However... it isn't quite ready yet!</p>

<p>As such I think that I'll be putting in a couple of late nights and early(ish) mornings to help get it ready for the grand opening.  Thus you can expect a week of quiet on this blog which you may be glad of!</p>
<p>Have a good week all!</p>
<small>Sub note: if any Worthinger wants to join me to see <i>Portland</i> on Saturday evening in East Grinstead please let me know!</small>
