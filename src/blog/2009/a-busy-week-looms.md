I think that the following week is going to be one that is rather busy and full! My church in Worthing is just coming to the end of a phase of massive building work and is being shown to the community on Saturday coming, which is very exciting. However... it isn't quite ready yet!

As such I think that I'll be putting in a couple of late nights and early(ish) mornings to help get it ready for the grand opening. Thus you can expect a week of quiet on this blog which you may be glad of!

Have a good week all!
