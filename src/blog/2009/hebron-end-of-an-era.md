Some of you will know for the last many years I have attended a Scripture Union camp called Hebron and this year I returned as a leader. The Hebron week at the beginning of the summer holidays has been a week that I have always looked forward to and it has been a time that I have made some great friend and really grown in my Christian faith. Hebron is a place where I have many life changing memories. Today, I found that this years Hebron was to be the last Hebron holiday to happen and I really am quite gutted by the news.

I would like to thank Colin and Margy, Matt, Phil, Paul, Dave &amp; Ruth, Dan, Amy, all of those from Nexus and all the other leaders that were there for my first years, thanks for everything that you put into making in happen. Verity; you will never be a real leader, but I love you anyway! Maz &amp; Trev; your cooking is just amazing, kept me going! Also a special thanks to Simon, Ben and Jenny, to Jessie, Ellie, Tom, Giles, Dom &amp; Owen for just being awesome… all of you wow! To everyone else who came as a camper and helped to make these weeks so special for me. And finally to Dave Panting; I owe you a lot, maybe see you again one day?

I've just been flicking back over some old photos… <a href="https://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2005388&amp;id=1094040393&amp;l=67309f2d8c">So</a> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jamesdoc/Hebron2007">many</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2025094&amp;id=1094040393&amp;l=8977098822">great</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2003844&amp;id=1094040393&amp;l=7dc8c3fea0">memories</a>.
