<p>It has come to the end of an era... the E70 has died a death... well half of it has, the main body still works however the flap has stopped working which is very upsetting, not least because at the moment I only have half of a QWERTY keyboard, and no number pad making it very difficult to phone or text.  So until further notice I have no phone.  I'll be honest, I'm not to cut up about not being able to make phone calls, et al; what I will miss is having my calendar to hand.</p><p>So far on the list of possible replacements is the E63 or the E75, however I'm fairly sure I'll cope without a phone, they are far too much of an invasion into my life!</p><p>I suppose I could always get an iPhone...</p>
