Don't worry there are no spoilers in the above clip! I came across this video today and found it a very accurate comparison with the new Star Trek film and A New Hope, plus providing the usual level of comedy that would be expected at College Humour! If you can't see the clip click <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1910892" target="null">here</a>

I plan to put together an entry reviewing the new Star Trek film, however you'll just have to wait for that one!
