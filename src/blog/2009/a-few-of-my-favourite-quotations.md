Here are a couple of my favourite quotes at the moment from a wide variety of sources!<br /><br /><i>"It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like 'What about lunch?"</i><br />- A. Milne<br /><br /><i>"What is the use of a book, without pictures or conversations?"</i><br />- Lewis Carroll<br /><br /><i>"Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so."</i><br />- Douglas Adams<br /><br /><i>"Build a man a fire, and he'll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and he'll be warm for the rest of his life."</i><br />- Terry Pratchett<br /><br /><i>"A naked man fears no pick-pocket."</i><br />- The Talking Moose<br /><br /><i>"Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe."</i><br />- Galileo Galilei<br /><br /><i>"An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last."</i><br />- Winston Churchill<br /><br /><i>"I believe in the sun even when it isn't shining. I believe in love even when I am alone. I believe in God even when He is silent"</i><br />- Anonymous<br /><br /><i>"The beauty of grace, is that it makes life not fair"</i><br />- Matthew Thiesen<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-2505538404757806018?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
