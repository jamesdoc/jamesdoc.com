<p>Mutemath have just released tour dates following on from the release of their second album Armistice.  The album is due for release on the 18th of August with a release party in their home town; New Orleans at the House of Blues.</p>
<p>It's a shame that there are not UK dates, maybe next year MuteMath? More details about the album can be found in my <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/mutemath-armistice">previous blog post</a>.</p>
