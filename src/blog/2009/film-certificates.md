Sex references may reflect what is likely to be familiar to most adolescents but should not go beyond what is suitable for them.<br /><br />Violence must not dwell on detail. There should be no emphasis on injuries or blood. Sexual violence may only be implied or briefly and discreetly indicated.<br /><br />Dangerous techniques (eg combat, hanging, suicide and self-harming) should not dwell on imitable detail or appear pain or harm free. Easily accessible weapons should not be glamorised.</blockquote>Is it me or is sexual activity a tad vague? &nbsp;You could get away with almost anything in films under a 12a certificate then... actually Quantum of Solace pretty much did. &nbsp;However note the fifth and seventh word; '<i>implied</i>' and '<i>references</i>'. &nbsp;If I am reading this correctly, under this rating you can only imply sexual&nbsp;activity, not actually show it.<br /><br />Now onto the following two categories, violence and imitation. &nbsp;How on earth did the Dark Knight pass these? &nbsp;You have this scene within the film where one of the lead characters, Harvey Dent, is missing half of his face, and this is dwelled on in graphic detail.<br /><br />Also from all sides, Batman, the Joker, the police and Two Face violence is seen as the only way to get things done, the whole film is just one fight after another. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, there is a story line running though, however it is held together with knives and fists. &nbsp;That in itself seems to be glamorising easily&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;weapons?<br /><br />Am I saying that the BBFC is a broken system? No I'm not, however it has been making mistakes, and an increasing number recently. &nbsp;The rules need to be tightened up, maybe even rewritten in some cases. &nbsp;The 12a certificate was a mistake, and one that needs to be rectified. &nbsp;Maybe I have an old-fashioned view of things; I'm not used to this modern world, however I don't think it is a great idea that sex and violence should be thrown&nbsp;at that level&nbsp;to 12 year olds...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-7965086068612134503?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
