<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://img70.imageshack.us/img70/6417/dysonfanpr1.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://img70.imageshack.us/img70/6417/dysonfanpr1.jpg" width="373" /></a><br /></div>Our favourite over priced <a href="http://www.dyson.co.uk/vacuums/">vacuum cleaner</a> producer and recently <a href="http://www.dyson.co.uk/dryers/">hand driers</a> have done it again, another revolutionary design that probably does a fantastic job and a ridiculous price; Dyson have just released a fanless fan... also known as the <a href="http://www.dyson.co.uk/fans/">Dyson Air Multiplier</a>. &nbsp;The fan does have blades within it, however not in the traditional place; the blades are located in the lower compartment and then the air is then pushed up into the ring. &nbsp;The fan will come in two models; a ten inch costing $300 and a twelve inch for $330... While is it expensive I really want one!<br /><br />The laptop company Acer have just launched their latest netbook last Wednesday, normally this wouldn't be notable news for my blog, I reserve that for important tech news... like desk fans, however this netbook will dual-boot (will have two operating systems) the first will be Windows 7, and the second will be Google's Android. &nbsp;The machine isn't touchscreen which will make using Android a little odd, however from what I have been reading as long as you don't have massive thumbs the machine is easy enough to use!<br /><br />Finland has proven that they are ahead of the game in the world of tech by today introducing laws that guarantee broadband access to all the population of Finland (roughly 5.5 million people). &nbsp;The law will come into effect in July next year and will ensure each household has access to at least a 1mb connection at which will be extended over time to a seriously impressive 100mb connection.<br /><br />Nokia have had a really really bad last 3 months, having lost $834 million... this is despite the N97 being released recently. &nbsp;With Apple, HTC and Palm doing quite nicely at the moment someone had to take a fall, it is just a shame that it is Nokia.<br /><br />I mentioned last week about the upcoming Adobe Flash update coming somewhen with iPhone app support, Adobe have put out more details about some of the technology going into the next release of photoshop; for those interested there is a brief 5 minute video showing off two of the new features on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BShE_jS8jLE&amp;feature=player_embedded">YouTube</a>.<br /><br />And to end in the fashion of many news broadcasts with the funny news story of the week; in an effect to prevent fake cereal being sold Kelloggs are looking to laser their logo on to every corn flake that they make... seems a little over kill to me, however very cool! You really can't go wrong with lasers!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-4215463604618344301?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
