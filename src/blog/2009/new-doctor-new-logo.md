The BBC have just released more excitement regarding Doctor Who 2010. Alongside a new Doctor and assistant, a slightly modified exterior of the TARDIS which will probably mean a new inside there is also going to be a new logo and therefore a new title sequence to welcome Matt Smith into his role as the 11th Doctor.

Matt Smith will come into the role as part of the Christmas specials this year which will be a two part extended mini-series. This will then lead into the fifth series starting in Spring.
