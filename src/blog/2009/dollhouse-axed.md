The news is in, and it's not good; Dollhouse is being axed after just two seasons. Fox has said that all the episodes that have been planned will be made allowing the show to wrap up loose ends, however I just want more! Dollhouse is great, I have really been enjoying it, it doesn't deserve to be canceled so soon.

The final order of release is as follows:

- Dec. 4 - 8:00PM-10:00PM ET/PT (Episodes 5 &amp; 6)
- Dec. 11 - 8:00PM-10:00PM ET/PT (Episodes 7 &amp; 8)
- Dec. 18 - 8:00PM-10:00PM ET/PT (Episodes 9 &amp; 10)
- Jan. 8 - 9:00PM-10:00PM ET/PT (Episode 11)
- Jan. 15 - 9:00PM-10:00PM ET/PT (Episode 12)
- Jan. 22 - 9:00PM-10:00PM ET/PT (Episode 13 / Series Finale)
