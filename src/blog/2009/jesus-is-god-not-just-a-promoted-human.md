<p>Jesus is eternal, He lasts forever, not like a created thing... This was one of the things that was said at the sermon I listened to today.  It just stuck out, and I wanted to share it... In this changing world, Jesus remains steadfast, He is the same; yesterday, today and forever.</p>
<p>An athlete is constantly training to reach their peak level, however Jesus is always at His peak, He never left it, always at the full potential.  There is no one better to aid us, because although He doesn't need to change, we do?</p>
