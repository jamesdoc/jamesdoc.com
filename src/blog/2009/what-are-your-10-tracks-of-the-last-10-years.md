This week some of the bloggers I follow have been looking back on the last year and also the last decade of music and picking out their favourites...

Within the next week I look to be doing the same, however before I do I was wondering what do you think? What would you put down as your favourite album of the last year? Or what 10 tracks sums up the last ten years?

Write your thoughts in the comments below!
