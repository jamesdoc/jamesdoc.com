<p>For those who have been following what I have been doing with Harold will know that I've been trying to get him to walk... well I have vaguely succeeded... there is still a lot of work do be done on the animation so I'm going to leave it like this unless I get time to do some touch up work on the animation to make it a tad smoother!</p><br /><a href="http://jamesdoc.awardspace.co.uk/extra/HaroldWalking.swf">http://jamesdoc.awardspace.co.uk/extra/HaroldWalking.swf</a>
