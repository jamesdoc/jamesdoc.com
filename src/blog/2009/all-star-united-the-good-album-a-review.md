<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/1918/allstarunitethegoodalbu.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="420" src="http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/1918/allstarunitethegoodalbu.jpg" width="420" /></a></div><br />So it's been a while since I have done a CD review, and I've been meaning to write this one up for at least a week! &nbsp;So the eagerly awaited 'Good Album' has been released after a three year absence of new material for the American based band All Star United (ASU). &nbsp;I'll start off by saying that Love and Radiation (2006), their previous album, is fantastic, it is an album that I still rate with five stars, and that it had set a very high bar for The Good Album.<br /><br />The album weighs in at 11 tracks, coming to a disappointing 35 minutes, however that is fairly similar to Love and Radiation, so I won't judge yet! &nbsp;The opening track, Surface of the Sun, opens with a sound that is distinct from their previous offerings, however at the same time very ASU! &nbsp;It is loud, catchy and very in your face. &nbsp;Suffice to say, that the album opens well.<br /><br />This continues throughout the album, track two; Is This The Moment, is another ASU track, it has a very distinctive rocky beat with clear lyrics. &nbsp;The Blame drops the tempo into a thought provoking track three; "all the things you cover up, I'll wear them like the wounds of love, and hold you till there's nothing left to say..."<br /><br />Crashing Cars is the most ASU keeps up the sound of loud and summery, which is seen a lot in previous album, and track seven; Dude... That's Freakin' Awesome came out of the same mould as 'The Song of the Year' off of Love and Radiation. &nbsp;It looks to be Ian Eskelin's opinion on modern culture at the moment, one of the best lines being "you quit your job so you could play world of warcraft everyday." &nbsp;The track has already made it onto the tubes and you can find a little montage on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiVSNTQNSr0">YouTube</a>&nbsp;(link probably not suitable for work).<br /><br />Okay, so my final opinion. &nbsp;The album is good, very good, however not as good as Love and Radiation. &nbsp;It still has ASU written all over it and that is great, however it just lacks something new to define it. &nbsp;Maybe it will grow on me more, however at the moment it will just have to deal with just missing the five stars and being awards four instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;tracks&nbsp;that&nbsp;stand&nbsp;out&nbsp;for&nbsp;me&nbsp;are&nbsp;Surface&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Sun,&nbsp;The&nbsp;Blame&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;a&nbsp;Killer.<br /><br />You&nbsp;can&nbsp;listen&nbsp;to&nbsp;more&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;album&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;band's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/allstarunited">MySpace&nbsp;page</a>, or you can purchase the album from <a href="http://direct.crossrhythms.co.uk/product/77372">Cross Rhythms</a> for &pound;9.97, or if you prefer download the album from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Good-Album/dp/B002EQH952/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1247787886&amp;sr=8-9">Amazon.co.uk</a> for &pound;5.99.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-7815345424255413889?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
