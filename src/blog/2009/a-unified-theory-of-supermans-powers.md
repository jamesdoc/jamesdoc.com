I had to read it a couple of times!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/1584/500xsuperfall.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="315" src="http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/1584/500xsuperfall.jpg" width="420" /></a><br /></div><br />It's fine, Ben gives us some helpful examples!&nbsp; If you have seen anything of Superman you will have noticed that sooner or later a person will have found themselves trying to be a bird... and some what unsuccessfully; Lois Lane is falling through the sky and Superman flies along to rescue her... what a hero!&nbsp; Now what we would expect to see is Superman fly along and then dip to match her rate of falling and then pull her back up, if he did not Lois Lane might as well hit the ground, Superman is just as solid... However what we see is Superman flies straight, intersects the falling Miss Lane and keeps on going with a somewhat flustered Lois Lane.<br /><br />So the theory states that as soon as Superman makes contact with the falling damsel in distress he reduces her momentum to cushion her fall, rather than adjust the air around him to support him...<br /><br />If you are curious about reading the whole document (which I highly recommend) you should check it out here: <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/fanart/superman.pdf">www.qwantz.com</a>.
