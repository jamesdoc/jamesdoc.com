I am still waiting for Heroes to be as epic as it should be.&nbsp; Dollhouse and Stargate Universe <i>will</i> be fantastic, and I will wait and see about Sanctuary, but I am hopeful for it!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-5237680372262313957?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
