Over the last year I have rarely got excited over what is showing on the box, especially after the cancellation of Stargate Atlantis and the conclusion of Battlestar Galactica. However this autumn is looking like it is going to be rather exciting. Firstly the return of The Big Bang Theory and Heroes on Monday. Last night saw the much anticipated airing of season two of Dollhouse in the US, which I personally am very excited about!

Then over the following few Fridays we will see the premier of Stargate Universe (which had better not disappoint) and the following week the second season of Sanctuary. I am personally surprised that Sanctuary got renewed... however I will not complain about it, I thought it had much potential!

I may be tempted to do a review of the start of each season... we will see how excited I am about each. However at the moment Big Bang Theory is still awesome and Heroes had a really good start, which if the previous seasons are anything to go by it will just end the season with a massive load of awesomeness thrown away, the season endings have just been poor... I am still waiting for Heroes to be as epic as it should be. Dollhouse and Stargate Universe <i>will</i> be fantastic, and I will wait and see about Sanctuary, but I am hopeful for it!
