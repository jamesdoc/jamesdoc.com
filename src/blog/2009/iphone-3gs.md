<p>So as one of my previous blog entries mentioned, Apple are going to be realeasing a updated model to the iPhone called the iPhone 3GS.&nbsp; While the design of the device is unchanged from the iPhone 3G there has been a lot of changes under the hood improving hardware, making the gadget faster to allow for upgrades to the software.</p>
<p>There are two main hardware updates that will be really noticed by the user; firstly the camera has finally been updated to a 3 megapixel camera giving a higher resolution to the image.&nbsp; That said the lense that was in the iPhone and the iPhone 3G was fairly stunning, however this update should make it even better.&nbsp; In addition to this the camera now has auto-focus which is very nice and a new feature called touch-focus, which means that you tap the area that you want to be in focus and then the camera makes that area in focus!&nbsp; The update also allows the camera to record video, which is nice of Apple!</p>
<p>The second update is simply a bigger hard drive, which I have to say: 'finally!' 16Gb just wasn't enough for me, so they have whacked the capacity up to 32Gb.&nbsp; This, unfortuantly, makes the device very tempting for me now!</p>
<p>The updates that won't be as obvious to the user are a 600MHz processor, 256Mb RAM, and a much improved graphics chip.&nbsp; Coming together this means that everything about the iPhone is going to be faster and slicker.&nbsp; Apps will be able to be more complex, and it means that there will be more graphic intensive games for the iPhone, which isn't a bad thing!</p>
<p>Now the iPhone (and iPod Touch) have also had a massive software update, for the iPhone 3GS it will make use of the updated hardware, for the previous models it add in features such as cut, copy, paste, Spotlight search through all the data in the phone, MMS and a landscape keyboard throughout many apps... finally!&nbsp; However, these updates should of been in version one of the software.</p>
<p>So into the rant:</p>
<p>One and Two; iPhone 3GS... it is a lame name.&nbsp; The S stands for 'speed', which is fair enough, however I'm sure that they could of come up with something better.&nbsp; Two: I would of thought that a little modification into the design wouldn't of hurt... I mean those plastic backs look a little tacky to me?&nbsp; It's a great device, why not make it look beautiful all over, not just from the front, the original iPhone looked stunning!</p>
<p>Three: This is the big one, the price of the thing.&nbsp; I'll be honest; this is a great device, and the two little annoyances above are not going to put me off buying it, this is the update that I have been waiting for to make the leap.&nbsp; The reason that I am not buying the iPhone is O2.&nbsp; They are asking a stupid amount for the phone, I don't have an issue with paying the &pound;35 per month contract fee to get the 32Gb iPhone 3GS with 600 minutes, 500 texts and obviously unlimited data.&nbsp; However I do have a small issue with paying on top of that &pound;275 to get the handset with that contact.&nbsp; Seriously O2??? What are you playing at?&nbsp; To get the phone for free I would need to go into a 24 month contract and pay &pound;75 per month, and even then I would only get 500 texts?</p>
<p>Sticking around under pay as you go is also painful, however could be worse; the 32Gb handset on it's own costs &pound;540, I buy a Mac computer for cheaper than that!</p>
<p>Raghhh.</p>
