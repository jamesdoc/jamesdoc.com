They claim to have over 15 million phone numbers that they have managed to acquire by buying numbers off market research companies, online businesses and through companies that buy and sell lists of phone numbers.<br /><br />The directory service say that privacy is paramount and they will never actually pass on numbers to people, rather connect the calls.  The service will cost &pound;1 per number.<br /><br />The thing is, to me this just sounds like a further invasion of privacy... I don't hand out my mobile phone number to people for a reason; I don't want people to call me! I'd rather and text or an email any day.  So for this company to start handing out mobile numbers to people who want to find my mobile number because a little worrying!<br /><br />However never fear, you should be able to get your number off their database through their website: <a href="http://www.118800.co.uk/">www.118800.co.uk</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-8587755138582918833?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
