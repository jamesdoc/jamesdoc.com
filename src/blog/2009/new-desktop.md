I've been playing with a new desktop layout recently, new icons, clock etc (click the image to get a large copy!). I quite like it and felt like sharing with you all, I may be doing a little tweaking here and there, we shall see!

I've got a new project coming which will be announced shortly, as a result the blog updates may be more spaced out in the coming days!
