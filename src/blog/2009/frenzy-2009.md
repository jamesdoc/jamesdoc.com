Frenzy is a music festival that takes place each year in Edinburgh that attracts some of the biggest Christian bands from both the UK and US. It has been running since 2005 when it started as it meant to continue with Delirious?, Third Day and the Newsboys all heading to Scotland for one day of amazing music.

Year one attracted over 5000 people, and this number has just gone up with more and more people heading to Scotland to hear bands such as Tree63, Hillsong United, Chris Tomlin, yFriday, etc.

This year's festival is expecting to hit 10,000 people with even bigger bands including Starfield, Third Day, David Crowder Band, Jeremy Camp and Hillsong London taking up the main stage all day. On the other two stages are smaller bands such <a href="http://www.myspace.com/portlandmusicuk">Portland</a>, Blush UK, Superhero, [Dweeb] and thebandwithnoname.

It should be a great day for all who go, I just wish I could get up to Scotland for the weekend, I however am in Stafford all day!
