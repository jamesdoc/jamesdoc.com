It has been running since 2005 when it started as it meant to continue with Delirious?, Third Day and the Newsboys all heading to Scotland for one day  of amazing music.<br /><br />Year one attracted over 5000 people, and this number has just gone up with more and more people heading to Scotland to hear bands such as Tree63, Hillsong United, Chris Tomlin, yFriday, etc.<br /><br />This year's festival is expecting to hit 10,000 people with even bigger bands including Starfield, Third Day, David Crowder Band, Jeremy Camp and Hillsong London taking up the main stage all day.
