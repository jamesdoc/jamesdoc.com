This news item appeared on the BBC a couple of days ago. Some people have got together and created a 250m long jelly fish an Oxfordshire field. Obviosuly I do not condone the destruction of the crops, however I do have admire the precision in the creation of the the crop circle. Really quite stunning.

This crop circle comes close to beating, in my opinion, that of the Oregon State University Linux Society who got away from their terminal commands to create a 67 metre wide FireFox logo in a oat field. You can find details of that <a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/events/firefox/crop-circle">here</a>.
