Some people have got together and created a 250m long jelly fish an Oxfordshire field.  Obviosuly I do not condone the destruction of the crops, however I do have admire the precision in the creation of the the crop circle.  Really quite stunning.<br /><br />This crop circle comes close to beating, in my opinion, that of the Oregon State University Linux Society who got away from their terminal commands to create a 67 metre wide FireFox logo in a oat field. You can find details of that <a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/events/firefox/crop-circle">here</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-5681352740816857024?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
