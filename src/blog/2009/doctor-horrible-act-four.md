Right so, Dr Horrible was just one of the most fantastic online videos of this year, for those who haven't seen it please please go and have a look at it on YouTube… all three acts come in at only 45 minutes, well worth it!

Now the word on the street is that there will be more Doctor Horrible on the way… it is pretty much confirmed with Joss Whedon, creator, saying the only question is to do it â€œon a shoe string again" or goes bigger budget and â€œinvites other people into the process." Either way, I'm excited!

Also, Doctor Horrible also won an Emmy, a couple of nights ago which was very exciting for them, they had a fantastic video for their nomination speech.
