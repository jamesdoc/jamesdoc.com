Either way, I'm excited!<br /><br />Also, Doctor Horrible also won an Emmy, a couple of nights ago which was very exciting for them, they had a fantastic video for their nomination speech:<br /><br /><div style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-4786704741171209347?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
