Those who have been following my blog will have noticed an increase in music related posts on the blog over the last couple of months. &nbsp;This is because I have started writing for <a href="http://www.louderthanthemusic.co.uk/">LouderThanTheMusic.co.uk</a>, a website devoted to Christian music news, reviews, et al.

I figured with yFriday.org.uk being taken down due to lack of hits I would have some time on my hands, so rather than waste it put it to good use throwing my two cents in with a review here and there and news items as and when I came across them.

Keep your eyes on the site, it is a very good resource, they also have a <a href="https://twitter.com/louderthan">twitter account</a> and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1728810945">facebook profile</a>&nbsp;which is kept upto date by the site.
