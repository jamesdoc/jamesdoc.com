This summer they have a full festival schedule, however during this time they are putting pen to paper finalising the tracks for their new album&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;recorded&nbsp;this autumn.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-3815215018693668896?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
