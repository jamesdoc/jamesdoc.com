Back in March of last year Fireflight released their fourth album called Unbreakable, suffice to say it was stunning, one of the tracks even got featured on the 2008 Olympic soundtrack! This summer they have a full festival schedule, however during this time they are putting pen to paper finalising the tracks for their new album&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;recorded&nbsp;this autumn.
