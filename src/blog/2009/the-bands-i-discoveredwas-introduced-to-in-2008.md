1) Sabio... many thanks to Simon J for these guys! Seriously amazing band! They are no longer around however the one album that they did release, called Escape, although it didn't strike me at first, after several plays through moved closer and closer to my top ten list! The opening track Meaning of My Life is such an awesomely produced track! Love it!<br /><br />2) Live, also thanks to a Jiggins, a Ben this time.  I now own three of their CD's which I purchased for &pound;12 from the local independent music store!  They have 12 CD's around (7 studio, 1 live, 2 compilations and 2 EPs). The album Distance to Here works so well as an album, it also compliments my track 1 &amp; 4 theory; the best tracks will be the first and forth and this album does not let down, Dolphins Cry and Run to the Water are brilliant! I also recommend checking out the music video to Run to the Water!<br /><br />3) Shawn McDonald is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist.  While working in Wesley Owen I played his latest album Roots fairly constantly! He was often compared to Jason Mraz!<br /><br />4) Jason Mraz was introduced to me by Caitlin who has introduced me to many artists I would not of listened to before! Another American solo artist who has tracks that have bits of pop, rock, folk, jazz and hip hop... they are great!<br /><br />5) Paramore, yet another American band, are a riot... ok sorry bad pun!  I have Gareth to thank for these guys! Their 2nd studio album Riot! has gone platinum in the US and gold in the UK, my only complaint about the thing is that it was too short; 38 minutes!<br /><br />6) Luna Halo, courtesy of Mr David Taylor, yet another US alternative band who have released just two full albums and several EPs.  They did do an amazing cover of Hang on to You written by Martin Smith of Delirious?<br /><br />7) Kindle came via Gareth.  They are, like Sabio, a small Christian band, they are mostly known for their album Screaming Serenades which has a lot of influences of Muse in it!<br /><br />8) Bluetree another band that I found at Wesley Owen however never got round to purchasing their CD, they came to Lincoln in November, I purchased their CD there and then and have been playing it ever since! They were also supporting Delirious? at their Christmas gig!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-133659402670577976?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
