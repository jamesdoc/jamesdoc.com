Back in March of this year it was announced that Peter Furler would be stepping back from the Newsboys to be replaced by DC Talk's Michael Tait. Since then Tait has been touring with the band, however the question has always remained; what would the studio recording sound like? Recently Tait has re-recorded the vocals to the track Glorious taken from their latest album In the Hands of God.

Have listen to the YouTube clip below for a preview of the new sound.
