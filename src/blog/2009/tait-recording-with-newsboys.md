Recently Tait has re-recorded the vocals to the track Glorious taken from their latest album In the Hands of God.<br /><br />Have listen to the YouTube clip below for a preview of the new sound.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-1740158478857261818?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
