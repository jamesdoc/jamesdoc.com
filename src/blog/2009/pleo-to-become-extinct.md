You may remember [a previous couple of posts about Pleoâ€¦](/blog/2009/pleo-to-become-extinct/). Pleo is a little robot dinosaur who is just generally fantastic, anyone is welcome to buy me one for my birthday! However the company that produced them have come under the economy and have had to file for bankruptcy, which is shocking considering that last year Ugobe, Pleo's creators, sold over 100,000 of the things (that's worth \$35000000)!

Sad times :(
