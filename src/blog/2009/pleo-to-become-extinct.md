(see&nbsp;<a href="http://jamesdoc.blogspot.com/2008/05/what-have-they-done-to-you-pleo.html">here</a>). &nbsp;Pleo is a little robot dinosaur who is just generally fantastic, anyone is welcome to buy me one for my birthday! &nbsp;However the company that produced them have come under the economy and have had to file for bankruptcy, which is shocking&nbsp;considering&nbsp;that last year Ugobe, Pleo's creators, sold over 100,000 of the things (that's worth $35000000)!<br /><br />Sad times :(<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-2910529306009805576?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
