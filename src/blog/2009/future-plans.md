So I've just had a look through some of my older posts on this here blog, it is interesting to see how much I've changed in some respects, and in other ways stayed the same.  I'm thinking about re-doing some of these blog posts to make them more current and so that I can compare them to see how my opinions have changed and what I value of interest has changed!<br /><br />However, I would like to know what people think about what I write here, what they would like to see going up here and how I can make it more interesting, etc, little stories, more of what I'm doing at uni, more rants and or thoughts, music reviews? Let me know!
