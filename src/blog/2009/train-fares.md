Ok, sorry; incoming rant. But seriously how much are train fares??? And why does it cost me &pound;52.55 to get home to Worthing from Lincoln... Oh and that is with a young person's rail card... That is just too much generally. Plus I've booked this in advanced... going on the 9th April! I bet I won't even get a seat on that one carriage that East Midlands Trains put on to London.

ARGH
