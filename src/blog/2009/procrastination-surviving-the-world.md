In a major period of procrastination this afternoon (HCI assignment!) I was introduced to a daily web comic entitled Surviving the World. One guy, one blackboard, one piece of chalk = genius! If you get time, or like me you are just looking to be distracted I suggest you take a wander over to <a href="http://survivingtheworld.net/">http://survivingtheworld.net/</a><div><br />

Much appreciation to Caitlin for the original link: <a href="https://thedaysarenotfullenough.tumblr.com/">thedaysarenotfullenough.tumblr.com</a>
