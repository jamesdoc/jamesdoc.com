The week has ended, Hebron 2009 is at an end, what a week it has been! For those you who I haven't raved about Hebron to it is the camp that I have attended since I was twelve. Involved in the week is lots of fun, friendship and Bible teaching, seriously awesome week, so awesome that I keep going back!

This year I went back not as a camper but as a leader, a bit of a scary leap, however despite the early starts and the late finishes it was a fantastic week! The theme of the week was 'The Real You, The Glorious You?' This was based upon a slightly re-worked version of Colossians 3:1-4:

> So if you're serious about living for Jesus, act like it. Pursue the things over that Jesus loves. Don't shuffle along, eyes to the ground, absorbed with the things right in front of you. Look up, and be alert to what is going on around Jesus; that's where the action is. See things from his perspective.
> Your old life is dead. Your new life, which is your real life, is with Jesus. That's the real you, the glorious you

That in itself is a real challenge to me, it is going to mean a fair amount of changes in my life I know. All the talks were really good, and I just wanted to pull a couple of points that spoke to me out from them and mash them together quickly:

<ul><li>God everyone completely, he knows what you have done, what you are going to, everything that is beautiful and everything shameful yet he still loves you completely.  Even though you mess up in life, you're still the one that Jesus wants.</li><li>You have to step up to the challenge of living for Jesus, God loves you, now you have to respond to it, if you are serious about it live for it.</li><li>Character isn't part of your personality; character development is in the heart, we can work towards creating a character that better reflects God's love for us.</li></ul>

I have collated a fair amount of photos from the week, and there is video floating around on my laptop that I intend to upload tomorrow so watch this space for that!
