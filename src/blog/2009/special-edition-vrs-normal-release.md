Yesterday I wrote about a small piece of news about the latest release by Anberlin ([you can read it here](/blog/2009/anberlin-prepare-deluxe-edition-of-new-surrender/)), a year or so after the release of their latest album, New Surrender, they are releasing a special edition album with extra unreleased tracks, a documentary DVD, etc. This really annoys me, not the fact that they are releasing this material, but that the fact that they are doing this now!

I really like it when bands decided to give the real fans something extra; the casual listener can buy the normal edition whereas the fans can buy special edition, for a little bit extra, to get a collectors edition. For example the greatest hits album that has just been released by Delirious? came in two flavours; the normal edition which contained the top 14 Delirious tracks, and the special edition which came as a double disc album of 31 tracks with a DVD of their music videos and a 52 page book. This gave the casual listener the ability to just buy just the standard edition, while at the same time the fans could buy the special edition with the extras.

What Anberlin, and many other bands, have done is released the standard edition, which the collectors and the casual fans alike can go out and buy, and then released the special edition of the same album a year down the line so the collectors go and buy the album twice just to get these new tracks... some how doesn't seem fair. From a business point of the band in makes perfect sense to do it, especially coming up to Christmas, however from my view I want to get these new tracks, however I don't want to pay for the whole album again...

What are people's thoughts?
