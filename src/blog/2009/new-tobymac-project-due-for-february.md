A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/therealtobymac/status/3182401364">twitter update</a> from TobyMac places Relient K's front man, Matthew Thiessen, in the studio providing vocals for the new album being put together at the moment by TobyMac. This new album is the fourth studio album that TobyMac has put together since DC Talk parted ways in 2001.

Three of the track titles have already been announced:

- City on our Knees
- Get Back Up
- Captured

While you will have to wait until February 2010 for the album to be released, the first single City on our Knees will be released on the 14th August.
