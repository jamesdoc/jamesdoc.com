Please read this article from the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5312812/TV-shows-including-Doctor-Who-giving-children-nightmares.html">Daily Telegraph</a>.

Right, now that you have read it... I cannot comment on the likes of Ben 10, Power Rangers and Primeval having not read it, so I'll make Doctor Who the focus of this...

Sorry, but isn't the point of Doctor Who that is scary? I mean part of the point of Doctor Who is that you watch from behind your sofa? It is a family show, and as such it is aimed at all age ranges, and to the most part fulfils its purpose in my books... however if kids are getting scared of it, or parents are considering it to dark for a seven year old, surely it is the responsibility of the parent to not allow their kids to watch it? That's what my parents did...

We have a kids version of Doctor Who, it is called Sarah Jane Adventures, and we have an 'adult' version of Doctor Who called Torchwood (I have a rant about Torchwood, however now isn't the time or the place). Pushing Doctor Who back past the watershed is just going to turn it into a tamed version of Torchwood.

In addition to this, I remember reading an article earlier in the year that with the ability to get programs such as Doctor Who, Sarah Jane and Torchwood online, combined with the increasing technical ability on the computer by children means that they managed to access these programs no matter when the BBC aired them...

Moving a program to a different time slot will not help.
