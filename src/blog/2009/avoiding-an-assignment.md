There are two things that I normally do during essay time to avoid having to complete assignments, messing with websites and redoing my desktop set-up... During my latest essay on systems thinking (go and search for it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Thinking">wikipedia</a> ) I have done both!

So now my monitors looks like this:

I don't have time for this, however it is more fun than re-writing my <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesdoc/status/1209945268">introduction</a> ...

I have also found the usefulness that is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-visor/">Visor</a> mixed with <a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/30091/ithief">iThief</a>... I can now control iTunes through the Terminal... I feel very geeky! It's going to take a while to get my head around the commands, however it feels good!
