One thing that was said over and over again at the [Big Church Day Out](https://www.thebigchurchdayout.com/) yesterday was this; we cannot keep this to ourselves. It is great for the church to come together as one and celebrate, however we have to go out and share the passion for Jesus with the rest of the world.

I'm going to borrow an illustration for Steve Chalke, no matter of your opinion of the guy the illustration is good. If you go outside and get hit by a flake of snow your going to look up at the sky, however that single flake doesn't settle. If the whole area gets covered with tens of thousands of flakes of snow it will snow so hard that the whole traffic in the streets has to stop to look up and can go no further.

As Christians we can come together and have a great time, however if we don't take the Spirit back with us in to our communities, to our schools, to work places, to our friends what is the point? We are simply being hypocrites. We need to follow out the Great Commission that Jesus left in Matthew 28:

> Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age"

If we are not doing this we are missing one of the fundamental teachings of Jesus.
