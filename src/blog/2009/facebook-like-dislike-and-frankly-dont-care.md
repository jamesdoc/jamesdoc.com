Did you see what I did there?  It allows feedback to say "I've read this", or "I agree with it", or "I appreciated it", or ultimately "I like it".  Feedback is good, it allows interaction between users, and that is what Facebook, and all social networking sites, should be about.<br /><br />One of the nice things is that you don't have to write the comment to say that you like it, the user just hits the like button, nice and handy.  So then, the question is; where is the opposite feature? I want a 'dislike' button to say, actually I think you're wrong, or the 'apathetic' button to say I've read it, but I don't really care about it!  I want to have a quick way of giving feedback on something that has been posted.  It would also allow an expansion into a Digg like page for statuses; where status updates can be dugg up or buried on the news feed.<br /><br />Facebook: Please steal this idea!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-6432999060684701811?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
