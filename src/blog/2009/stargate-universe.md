The ship, called Destiny, is created by the Ancients to places the Stargates in different galaxies.<br /><br />MGM &amp; SyFy released this little press statement about it:<br /><blockquote>After unlocking the mystery of the Stargate's ninth chevron, a team of explorers travels to an unmanned starship called the Destiny, launched by the Ancients at the height of their civilization as a grand experiment set in motion, but never completed.<br /><br />What starts as a simple reconnaissance turns into a never ending mission, as the Stargate Universe crew discovers the ship is unable to return to Earth, and they must now fend for themselves aboard the Destiny.<br /><br />The crew will travel to the far reaches of the universe, connecting with each of the previously launched Stargates, thus fulfilling the Destiny's original mission. Challenges will arise though as the ship comes into range of Stargates placed centuries ahead of the Destiny and the crew is unable to control the ship's navigational schedule. If someone is left behind, there is no way to go back for them, adding to the drama of encountering new races, enemies and adventures.</blockquote>The producers have promised a bigger budget, a young cast, and to keep the wit and humour of SG1 and Atlantis, which is all good!  What I am worried about is that the whole series will be set in space... now that is fine, however all I am saying is that it had better not to turn into Star Trek Voyager...<br /><br />We shall wait and see, I'm hopeful about the whole thing, SG1 was good, Atlantis was good, with any luck Universe will be good to.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-4813572704342060315?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
