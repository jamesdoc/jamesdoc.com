Today is an election day; voting in many places on a local level, who makes the decisions about the town/city you live in, but also voting at an EU level.  These people essentially decide on what happens to Britian in relationship to Europe, at a basic level this effects things down to the cost of food in the UK, right through to health and safety rules in the workplace or into products manufactured.<br /><br />I'm going to keep this nice and simple, first provide you with a link to reasons why you should vote in the EU elections that is <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qolk2f">HERE</a>.  Secondly to give you a link to a friends blog who has kindly saved both you and I going through 10 popular parties and what they want out elections.  This can be found in <a href="http://amos-and-paul.blogspot.com/2009/06/so-having-reviewed-10-of-parties-that.html%20">Joe Williams' Blog</a>.<br /><br />Have a good day, please do vote.
