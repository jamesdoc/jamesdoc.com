A little intro to the start of this blog post... in the future, rather than blogging every exciting piece of tech news that comes my way as soon as I get it I am going to be collecting the news up into one blog post that I will put out each Monday. &nbsp;That way hopefully the blog won't get too tech heavy. &nbsp;That said, if something really really exciting and interesting happens I will probably blog it straight away! &nbsp;So without further ado.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://img183.imageshack.us/img183/1816/flashoniphone.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="291" src="http://img183.imageshack.us/img183/1816/flashoniphone.png" width="420" /></a><br /></div><br />Last Monday, a couple of hours after my previous blog post of Wave, Windows Seven and Amazon the company Adobe, responsible for programs like Photoshop, Dreamweaver and InDesign, to name a few, announced a very big feature for Flash Developers regarding the iPhone. &nbsp;Using their programming language; Action Script, current flash developers will be able to develop applications for the iPhone, and rather than run them as a plugin for the browser, the applications created will be able to run as native programs on the iPhone. &nbsp;In practice this means that iPhone development will be opened up to millions more developers so for iPhone and iPod Touch owners there will be more programs available in the App Store. &nbsp;For a (slightly) more in-depth intro, the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashcs5/appsfor_iphone/">Adobe website</a> is very helpful!<br /><br />As I mentioned last Monday, Amazon did indeed announce that they would be releasing an international version of the Kindle. &nbsp;At the moment, all this really means is that UK users will be able to import the device from the US for about &pound;200. &nbsp;The ability to buy books over the air on the device, rather than having to use the amazon website will also be included in that price. &nbsp;More details are available from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015T963C//ref=amb_link_84995193_2?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=gateway-center-column&amp;pf_rd_r=1BFRCBFTTADMK7Z4V4YW&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=472917413&amp;pf_rd_i=468294">Amazon.com</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://img75.imageshack.us/img75/1444/tmobilesidekicklxannoun.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="375" src="http://img75.imageshack.us/img75/1444/tmobilesidekicklxannoun.jpg" width="420" /></a><br /></div><br />And also, one of the biggest fails of cloud computing happened this week. &nbsp;My experience with T-Mobile has been a little less that great, poor signal, firmware taking forever to be 'validated', etc. &nbsp;However this is nothing compared to what T-Mobile have done to Sidekick users. &nbsp;99% of functionality of the phone is done through the net connection to the T-Mobile server, this includes things like contacts, address book, random files. &nbsp;Due to a massive massive fail by T-Mobile all the data of the server has been completely lost. &nbsp;That's right, T-Mobile don't have a backup and they lost all the data that is used by Sidekick users. &nbsp;Fail.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-3129053929914882359?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
