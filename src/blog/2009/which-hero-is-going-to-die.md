The quote from Michael Ausiello is this:<br /><blockquote>A male series regular on a one-hour drama - a onetime ratings powerhouse - learned that he was out of a job only after reading his character's death scene in the script! According to my mole, the popular and well-respected leading man - who tapes his final scenes this week - was blindsided not just by his ouster, but by the tacky way in which it was handled. "He was hurt that the producers didn't tell him first," says the source. "He deserved better."<br /></blockquote>So that narrows it down to the blatantly obvious... The males who have made it into the latest series are; Noah, Matt, Peter, Hiro, Ando and Sylar... and of all them who is dying? Hiro. &nbsp;So I think we can finally say goodbye to Hiro (and therefore Ando) very very soon!<br /><br />That said, it wouldn't exactly be a surprising death... and while I wouldn't mind saying goodbye to Hiro and Ando, I would also quite like to kill off Matt too...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-4869374382569152215?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
