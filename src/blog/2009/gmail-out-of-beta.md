I don't want to scare anyone… however GMail is finally out of beta… this could be the end of the internet as we know it!

GMail, or Google Mail, started back in April… 2004 offering users a scary amount of storage, a whole gigabyte, today, July 7th 2009, the beta period was lifted with the storage being just over 7Gb!

Its a bit sad really though. GMail coming out of beta is fantastic, however it is only going to get replaced with Google Wave shortly. Ahh well, we shall wait and see!
