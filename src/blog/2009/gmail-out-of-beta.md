<p>I don't want to scare anyone... however GMail is finally out of beta... this could be the end of the internet as we know it!</p>
<p>GMail, or Google Mail, started back in April... 2004 offering users a scary amount of storage, a whole gigabyte, today, July 7th 2009, the beta period was lifted with the storage being just over 7Gb!</p>
<p>Its a bit sad really though. GMail coming out of beta is fantastic, however it is only going to get replaced with Google Wave shortly.  Ahh well, we shall wait and see!</p>
