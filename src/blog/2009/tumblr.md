A couple of days I posted a tweet &amp; facebook status asking the point of Tumblr... should I sign up to yet another social networking site! The responses were generally, don't do it... 'soul sapping' was one phrase used (thanks Caitlin)!Another response was that there was nothing overly different from regular blogging (Rhys).

However curiousity got the better of me and I felt called to have a look. I have been playing around with it for the last couple of days and I think I have found a purpose for it in my social networking...

Often there are things that I spot on the interwebs that I think is one of the following: interesting, cool, slightly pointless but funny, etc and I want to post it somewhere for other people to see. This blog really isn't the place for it, because most of the time it would either be just one picture or a link to another site. This is where Tumblr fits in. Tumblr is a site for those random posts that don't really merit a blog post, so I can link to that cool <a href="http://modesty.blogspot.com/2009/08/lord-of-flies.html">blog post</a>, or put up a <a href="http://11.media.tumblr.com/rLRCbKmrqr2tnrbzJLCmylNio1_500.jpg">pretty picture</a>, etc!

There is a link to <a href="http://pixelthief.tumblr.com/">my Tumblr</a> at the top of the page on this blog, and I'll also stick a little feed along the left with my most recent Tumblrings! One thing that does slightly annoy me... where is the 'e' in Tumblr... it really should be spelt Tumbler... same goes for Flickr!
