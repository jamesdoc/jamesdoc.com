<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/8317/picture3zax.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="216" src="http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/8317/picture3zax.jpg" width="420" /></a></div><br />A couple of days I posted a tweet &amp; facebook status asking the point of Tumblr... should I sign up to yet another social networking site!&nbsp; The responses were generally, don't do it... 'soul sapping' was one phrase used (thanks Caitlin)!&nbsp;&nbsp; Another response was that there was nothing overly different from regular blogging (Rhys).<br /><br />However curiousity got the better of me and I felt called to have a look.&nbsp; I have been playing around with it for the last couple of days and I think I have found a purpose for it in my social networking...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/3048/jamesdoctumblr.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/3048/jamesdoctumblr.png" width="420" /></a></div><br />Often there are things that I spot on the interwebs that I think is one of the following: interesting, cool, slightly pointless but funny, etc and I want to post it somewhere for other people to see.&nbsp; This blog really isn't the place for it, because most of the time it would either be just one picture or a link to another site.&nbsp; This is where Tumblr fits in.&nbsp; Tumblr is a site for those random posts that don't really merit a blog post, so I can link to that cool <a href="http://modesty.blogspot.com/2009/08/lord-of-flies.html">blog post</a>, or put up a <a href="http://11.media.tumblr.com/rLRCbKmrqr2tnrbzJLCmylNio1_500.jpg">pretty picture</a>, etc!<br /><br />There is a link to <a href="http://pixelthief.tumblr.com/">my Tumblr</a> at the top of the page on this blog, and I'll also stick a little feed along the left with my most recent Tumblrings!&nbsp; One thing that does slightly annoy me... where is the 'e' in Tumblr... it really should be spelt Tumbler... same goes for Flickr!
