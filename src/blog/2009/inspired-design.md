<p>Can someone explain to me the difference between being inspired by a design, and just completely ripping it off? &nbsp;Where does taking one idea and using it in your design move into coping the design?</p>
<p>I'll use an example of our favourite company known for their design: Apple! &nbsp;They are well known for their design, and have <i>inspired</i>&nbsp;many other designers to create slick and clean websites, however I thought I will just showcase a couple of the more <i>inspired</i>&nbsp;designs below!</p>
<p><strong>Apple.com</strong><br /><img border="0" height="258" src="http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/2210/applemac1245060810778.png" width="420" /></p>
<p><b>GoG.com</b><br /><img border="0" height="249" src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/7892/gamescataloguegogcom124.png" width="420" /></p>
<p><b>Third Day.com</b><br /><img border="0" height="247" src="http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/150/officialwebsite12450609.png" width="420" /></p>
<p>Ok, so these are are two extreme cases, however where does the line get drawn with using ideas in other people's design? When does it become acceptable or unacceptable?</p><p>Has anyone really had an original thought?</p>
