Can someone explain to me the difference between being inspired by a design, and just completely ripping it off? Where does taking one idea and using it in your design move into coping the design?

I'll use an example of our favourite company known for their design: Apple! They are well known for their design, and have <i>inspired</i> many other designers to create slick and clean websites, however I thought I will just showcase a couple of the more <i>inspired</i> designs below

Ok, so these are are two extreme cases, however where does the line get drawn with using ideas in other people's design? When does it become acceptable or unacceptable?

Has anyone really had an original thought?
