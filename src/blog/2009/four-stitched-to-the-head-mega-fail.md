Ok… so the explanation to the facebook/twitter update… I had a minor incident with my bike that involved falling off into a parked car and then crawling to the side of the road and blacking out nicely… I honestly can't remember exactly what happened, however I think that the chain of my bike came loose from the cogs which knocked me off.

I awoke at the side of the road as an ambulance turned up to take me into A&amp;E which is where I stayed for a couple of hours. Four stitches later, plus a couple of oversized plasters, I was released at 22:00!

Yet, that is not where this story ends, 06:30 the following morning (Sunday) I was readmitted having thrown up the contents of my stomach at hourly intervals during the night. I stayed there until 10:00 Monday morning and have now been released into the world!

The bottom line - I am fine, stop panicking about me. Stitches come out on Friday.
