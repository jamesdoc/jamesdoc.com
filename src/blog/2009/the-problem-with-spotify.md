For those who have yet to come across Spotify (where have you been?) it is a very handy piece of software that allows you to listen to almost any music while not actually having to go out and buy the track, this is done through sponsorship in the form of adverts. I find this really useful if I want to sample an album, get a feel for it, to decide if I want to actually go out and pay for it!

While these adverts are necessary to allow Spotify to stay in business there really really needs to be changes made. The way I see it there are two main issues for me. Firstly the adverts really are not varied enough, if I am going to listen to an advert every (roughly) six tracks, which I generally\* don't mind, I really don't want to hear the same advert during each break... rather than promoting the product to me it actually puts me off it.

The second issue I have with the adverts is that 99% of the time they just have no relevance to me. Spotify should know quite a lot about me by my music taste, it can probably work out that giving me adverts about drug use or STDs just isn't relevant to me... If you are going to store my play history, which they must do, they could at least use it to benefit me?

Other than that, I think it is a great service!
