This time last year I wrote a <a href="http://jamesdoc.blogspot.com/2009/01/bands-i-discoveredwas-introduced-to-in.html">post</a> on the bands that I discovered in the previous year... and this year I think I'll do it again!<br /><br /><b>Portland</b><br />I have raved about Portland since I first heard them at Spring Harvest this year, how can they not be on this list?  The three piece from just outside Birmingham have a fantastic laid back style that I just love!  They are both fantastic live and in the studio which is a very good mix!<br /><br /><b>Al Gordon</b><br />I found about this guy via Dave Stephenson at Hebron this year.  He is what Survivor Records have branded as an 'Emerging Worship Leader' and his 8 track debut EP is stunning!  Well worth a listen<br /><br /><b>One Sonic Society</b><br />Forming out of the dust that is now Delirious? One Sonic Society is made up of Stu G, Jon Thatcher, Jason Ingram and Paul Mabury.  While they have yet to actually release an album or EP, the current tracks that they have released via their website (<a href="http://www.onesonicsociety.com/">http://www.onesonicsociety.com</a>) are sounding very promising!<br /><br /><b>Anchor and Braille</b><br />This is the acoustic solo project of Stephen Christian, lead singer of Anberlin, earlier this year Christian released the debut album Felt which went straight to #30 in one of the US charts<br /><br /><b>Canterbury</b><br />I have a Facebook status of Sam Hailes to thank for this one, Canterbury offered their debut album '<a href="https://fan.musicglue.com/sale/promoproducts.aspx?productid=98d5d1a0-807b-4038-8587-2b70507b0ee1">Thank You</a>' online and after downloading and having a listen to it I really enjoyed it!  They have been touring around the country for the last couple of months and have picked up quite a following (2000 downloads in the first day).  Well worth a listen if you get the time!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-6220504104408655984?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
