Ok, so I got excited about Dr. Horrible, and about act 4 which is coming soon... However at the moment I am getting excited about the fan made prequel, the footnote reads:

> "Any similarity to the characters created by Joss Whedon is, like, totally a coincidence, and by 'coincidence' we mean accidental, and by 'accidental' we mean fortunate, and by 'fortunate' we mean intentional, and by 'intentional' we mean unauthorised... please don't sue us Joss.'

Which is in itself is hilarious, and the Horrible Turn is equally funny, learning from the model of Dr Horrible. It is a beautiful. Such a well made job! Good effort guys!
