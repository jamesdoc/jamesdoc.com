However at the moment I am getting excited about the fan made prequel, the footnote reads:<br /><blockquote>"Any similarity to the characters created by Joss Whedon is, like, totally a coincidence, and by 'coincidence' we mean accidental, and by 'accidental' we mean fortunate, and by 'fortunate' we mean intentional, and by 'intentional' we mean unauthorised... please don't sue us Joss.'<br /></blockquote>Which is in itself is hilarious, and the Horrible Turn is equally funny, learning from the model of Dr Horrible. &nbsp;It is a beautiful. Such a well made job! Good effort guys!<br /><br />Have a watch on <a href="http://vimeo.com/7537771?hd=1">Viemo</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31453821-1992258633968266010?l=www.jamesdoc.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
