<p>So here it is, back in 2007 the awesome band from Northern Ireland called Bluetree released an amazing debut album called Greater Things.  Then the year later they got signed by Fierce who then remastered it for them and re-released it. Then this album got picked up by Chris Tomlin who covered their song God of this City, and as such Bluetree got big in America so it seemed only polite to release the album over there, however rebranding and renaming it for them.  That in itself I don't have an issue with?</p>
<p>Why why why oh why is it being re-re-released in the UK again?  This time by Survivor, however why is it being put about again in the UK? Can't the band release some new material or something?</p>
<p>Ah well, it doesn't stop the album from being awesome!  You can read my first thoughts of the band in a <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/bluetree-greater-things">previous post</a>.</p>
