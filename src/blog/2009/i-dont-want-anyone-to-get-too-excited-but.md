Excited Voice: David Tennant might be playing Bilbo Baggins in screen adaption of The Hobbit...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/808/tennantrecorder2786136i.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="270" src="http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/808/tennantrecorder2786136i.jpg" width="420" /></a></div><br />The Telegraph has been reporting that David Tennant is top of the list to take the part of Bilbo Baggins in the new set of films being directed by Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, Blade 2).  Unfortunately, also in the list of potential Bilbo Baggins' are James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe...  Hugo Weaving, Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis are rumoured to reprise their roles from Lord of the Rings as Elrond, Gandalf and Gollum respectively.<br /><br />Now what I would really of loved is for Ian Holm to reprise his role and then have in doctored by the CGI team to make him look a lot younger... however I will not complain about David Tennant being given the role.<br /><br />The Hobbit will be broken up into two films, telling one story, almost like a two part TV series, much like Kill Bill 1 &amp; 2 were... however hopefully without the baggage of Kill Bill!<br /><br />Peter Jackson who is co-producing the film said:<br /><blockquote>â€œWe decided it would be a mistake to try to cram everything into one movie, The essential brief was to do The Hobbit, and it allows us to make The Hobbit in a little more style, if you like, of the [LOTR] trilogy."</blockquote><br /><br />And I'll also use this time to throw in a new shot from the filming of Doctor Who...<br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/9532/doctorwhokarengillana00.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="420" src="http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/9532/doctorwhokarengillana00.jpg" width="280" /></a></div>I'm curious to what kind of Doctor he will turn out to be... could be interesting! There is a nice BBC press page <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/07_july/20/who.shtml">here</a> for anyone interested.
