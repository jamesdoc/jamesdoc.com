<p>I'm working on a full review of <i>These Broken Hands</i> by Portland, it is coming.  However during my listening of the album, I got it yesterday and I'm listening to it currently for the 10th time, the song '<i>The Letter</i>' stood out, and the lyrics really struck me.  As a result I though I would share them with you here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Letter</strong></p>
<p>I hear there's a letter,<br />That you wrote for me to read tonight.<br />It tells me you're leaving,<br />But you wrote to say that it was alright.<br />They came and bound your hands;<br />And led you away from me,<br />I couldn't help the tears,<br />They treated you so violently.</p>
<p>Remember you speaking,<br />You taught me of love, life and myself.<br />But I couldn't help weeping,<br />I knew that your time was close at hand.<br />NoI couldn't bear to see<br />All the pain they put your through.<br />It was too much for me,<br />The streams iof blood it flowed from You.</p>
<p>Don't let them strike you again now my friend,<br />You have the power to make it all end.<br />Why do you silently take all the pain?<br />When deep in your heart you were bearing my shame.</p>
<p>They came and bound your hands,<br />And led you away from me.<br />But you gazed into my eyes,<br />And spoke again so lovingly.<br />'Cause this is for you,<br />The pain I'll go through to make all things new.<br />Without me tonight,<br />You've no hope in sight, and for you I'll die.</p>
<p>And the came and bound my hands<br />And led me away from you.<br />This is the only way I'll have<br />Of saving you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The album is just beautiful, you can hear some of their other tracks on their MySpace: <a href="http://myspace.com/portlandmusicuk">myspace.com/portlandmusicuk</a>.  The full review is coming soon, and I may post some more lyrics up later as well!</p>
