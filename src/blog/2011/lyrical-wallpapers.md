 The banner image is just a thumbnail from some work posted on <a href="http://joshhailes.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/3-new-lyrical-wallpapers/" target="_blank">Josh Hailes&#39; blog</a>. He posted three images he put together in Photoshop over the last couple of months as high resolution wallpapers - worth a download! While the images in themselves are very impressive it is the simple addition of the lyrics that got me thinking.</p>
<p>
 The caption &#39;You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name&#39; is a snippet from Laura Story&#39;s song &#39;Indescribable&#39; * which is all about God being revealed through creation (<a href="http://bible.us/Ps19.1.NLT" target="_blank">Psalm 19:1</a>). &nbsp;I really love how the image that Josh has produced captures the element of creation in the stars, revealing something of the mystery of God. &nbsp;Josh writes:</p>
<blockquote>
 &quot;...I was just amaaazed at the universe and how big and complex it is, and how insignificant I am in comparison! This was the result...&quot; -

 This picture begins to visualise just some of that song to me, and it prompted me go through some of the lyrics that I really like for one reason or another and think what kind of picture I would attach to them...&nbsp;I love it when lyrics jump out of songs at you, sometimes it is an entire song or just a chorus or verse, maybe even a line or two that really catches you off guard. &nbsp;One of those lines hit me yesterday as I was working:</p>
<blockquote>
  &quot;The only thing worth holding onto is holding onto me.&quot; - 
  Tonight - <a href="http://jeremycamp.com/" target="_blank">Jeremy Camp</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I&#39;m still in the process of settling into Oxford, if I&#39;m honest I&#39;m finding it difficult; it is very different from going to university where everyone else is in the same boat - everyone else is new. &nbsp;Starting out in a new city is harder, everyone else has been here for a while, they are in the routine of their Oxford life, while I am still trying to find mine. &nbsp;This line caught me and nudged me to remember that even in the tough times like moving to a new city that God is holding onto me, that as everything changes in my life God is constant and that He&#39;s not going anywhere.</p>
<p>
 I&#39;m still trying to work out what image I would use to visualise this line, the closest I have got to is of <a href="http://wwwdelivery.superstock.com/WI/223/4029/PreviewComp/SuperStock_4029R-403775.jpg" target="_blank">two people clasping each other&#39;s wrists</a>&nbsp;with the words interwoven&nbsp;around their arms. &nbsp;I&#39;ll try and recreate it in Pixelmator at some point</p>
<p>
 I&#39;ll leave you with these questions: What song, or lyrics in a song, really jump out at you when you listen to it, what is the story behind it for you? And what image do you associate with the words?</p>
