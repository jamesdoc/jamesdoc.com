<p>Did you read my small <a href="http://jamesdoc.com/blog/show/a-spotify-usability-failing">rant about Spotify</a> back in October last year? If you didn't like it I wouldn't read this one, it is in a similar vein?</p>
<p>With the new release of iTunes 10, with it's new icon, and iTunes Ping (remember that?) came a small, but huge, change to the application; the repositioning of the minimise, maximise and close window buttons (Windows users don't have to worry about this one). &nbsp;These buttons have always sat in a horizontal line on the top left of the window, however for some unexplained reason the buttons in iTunes 10 decided that being&nbsp;horizontal&nbsp;was boring and became vertical?</p>
<p>Moving these buttons is a trend that is seeming to catch on too... the fantastic piece of software <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>&nbsp;and Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/">App Store</a> have also slightly repositioned these buttons, nudging them to be vertically centred in the window bar, see the picture at the top.</p>
<p>Neither of these modifications are bad, however it completely breaks the uniformity of operating system's interface. &nbsp;For advanced users this change at the worst is a little annoying, however for users who&nbsp;struggle&nbsp;to find their way to the power button computer this change can be really confusing.</p>
<p>The only justification I can see for these changes is that Apple is doing a bit of testing to see the feedback on the button change for their next release of <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/lion/">OSX: Lion</a>; if people like the change then it will head across to all applications, if users don't like it then it simply won't! &nbsp;Either way, I'm looking forward to some form of consistency restored to interface!</p>
