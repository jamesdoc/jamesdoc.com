<p>One of the people I follow on Twitter, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/benhollebon" target="_blank">@benhollebon</a> posted a link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0oHlX8Kmxk" target="_blank">this video</a> earlier with the simple title 'Thought Provoking'.  It's not a short YouTube clip, but it does match the title.  It's a really simple video asking some really big questions about life, one of my favourite 'What motivates you - love or fear?'</p>
<p>I'm still thinking about how I would answer all of them, perhaps I'll run a blog series on them after my dissertation has been handed in.  In the mean time have a think yourself... what motivates you in life? Love or Fear?</p>
