<p>So you will have noticed that of late this blog has been fairly quiet... it is not because I have been short of ideas, it is because I have been short of two things:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Time - Having just started a new job where I spend most of my time in front of a computer screen I get home from work and don&#39;t really want to spend more time infront of a computer. &nbsp;Crazy I know</li>
 <li>The blog wasn&#39;t really complete... I spent a lot of time before moving to Oxford trying to get this blog up and running before starting work. &nbsp;As it happened I got a lot done, just not the part that allowed me to write new entries... Not clever.</li>
</ol>
<p>However I can announce that as of today I actually have a cool form that allows me to type in blog posts. &nbsp;There is still a lot of work to be done (I have a very long list of web development ideas for this site), and I have a nice long list of things that I want to write about on this blog, so I may start on those lists at some point in the near future, &nbsp;but for now I am going to log off and read a book!</p>
<p>Have a good Sunday afternoon.</p>
