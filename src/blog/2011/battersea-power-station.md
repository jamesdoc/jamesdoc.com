 I&#39;ve spent the evening playing around with <a href="http://pixelmator.com" target="_blank">Pixelmator</a>&nbsp;and thought I would share some of what came out of it. The final version of this image is up on my <a href="https://plus.google.com/100482726574378941628/posts/Kf2wHN7cxWK" target="_blank">Google+ account</a>*.&nbsp;</p>

 Many thanks to Sebastian Crump for putting his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramson/2694654009/" target="_blank">image</a> up as Creative Commons on Flickr.</p>
